    <h2>RodneyFun Official Bio</h2>
    <h3>Japanese</h3>
    <p style="width:600px;">
    いつもパジャマを着ているから、ニックネームはP.J.(Pajama)! 趣味は食べることと、寝ること、音楽を聞くことです。 見た目も行動もおっとりマイペースなのんびりやさんですが、パラッパタウンのCLUB FUNでは凄腕DJに変身します。 ピーナッツバターとドーナツが大好物で、サニー・ファニーの作った特製手料理もぺろりとたいらげるくいしんぼうです。

    <h3>Translated</h3>
    <p style="width:600px;">
    "Because he always wears pajamas, his nickname is PJ (which stands for pajamas)!
    His hobbies include eating, sleeping and listening to music. His appearance
    and demeanor might be seemingly calm, nonchalant and easygoing, but at PaRappa
    Town's Club Fun he transforms into a master DJ. His favorite foods are peanut
    butter and donuts, and he is enough of a glutton to eat up Sunny Funny's
    own cooking quickly."
    </p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>
    PJ is a brown teddy bear. He is of a small stature, being either
    at or slightly shorter than PaRappa and Sunny. His appearance
    implies he's naked, but other information implies he's actually clothed
    and just puts whatever outfits he might need to wear at the moment
    above his pajamas.<br>He has black eyes and a purple nose.
    </p>
    <p>
    When he enters into his PJ DJ persona, he puts on a pair of
    sunglasses with green rims and headphones, as well as adopting a more
    serious, rather than disinterested expression.
    </p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>
    PJ is generally a very calm and relaxed individual, with a leisurely
    pace in life and a habit of taking things as they come. He can be
    seen as kind of stoic at first, but in reality, he is very caring
    and willing to help his friends whenever they need it, often giving
    advice to his friend Parappa.
    </p>
    <p>
    One of PJ's greatest pleasures in life is eating, and he can very
    often be seen eating far more than he could or should, mostly donuts,
    but also any other kind of meal.<br>In addition to eating, he also
    loves sleeping, and takes naps frequently. This causes some to consider
    him lazy. He has an extensive and complex imaginary world in his
    dreams, in which he is a ruler of a kingdom and lives alongside his
    servants who feed him donuts and a population that loves him.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, this doesn't mean he's completely unemotional. He's shown
    to be impressed by Joe Chin's limousine in the first game, and seems
    to be easier to impress than people think. In addition, he also
    doesn't like for his sleep to be interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
    When he DJs at Club Fun, however, he adopts a much more serious
    persona, one that shifts between a serious face and a rad grin, never in
    between. Despite it all, he still shows
    his passion and keeps himself composed much like his usual self.
    </p>

    <h2>Appearances</h2>
    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper</h3>
    <p>
    In the first game, PJ is introduced to the players as one of
    PaRappa's friends.<br>
    Following the Jet Baby movie, PaRappa and friends order some food, and
    he chooses a giant chocolate frosty and a large pie, which reflect his
    gluttony.<br> He ends up being shocked by the size of Joe Chin's
    car in the Stage 2 cutscene, calling it "phat", and when Sunny's
    birthday party comes along, he ends up getting the presents after a
    game of <em>jan-ken-pon</em> (rock-paper-scissors).<br>
    At the end of the game, he appears in his DJ PJ persona to support
    Parappa in the final stage.
    </p>
    <h3>Um Jammer Lammy</h3>
    <p>
    PJ is an important character in the cutscenes for Parappa's stages
    in the game. He makes up some ideas for MilkCan's concert venue early
    on, then decides to start a band with PaRappa later, which goes
    hilariously wrong.
    </p>
    <h3>RodneyFun Comic Collection</h3>
    <p>
    PJ is the main character in the PJ's Dreamland comic book, which
    focuses on his inner dream world. We are shown his daily schedule, as
    well as PJ Land, the kingdom he rules over in his dreams. He is beloved
    by the people there, and he also does live shows that quickly sell out
    too.<br> At one point in the story, Sunny Funny gives him some of her
    cooking, and after he eats it, he immediately takes a nap, which leads
    him to have a dream where his kingdom gets invaded by an army of
    PaRappas, which throw him into a pit as a way to signify the end of
    his dream. Following this dream, he throws away the food Sunny made for
    him and goes back to his normal schedule, but PaRappa and Sunny find him
    at Club Fun and salute him, which leads him to frown at them due to his
    frustration with Sunny's food and makes them wonder what happened to
    him.
    </p>
    <p>
    He also plays a role in the other three comics happening in the
    PaRappa universe. In Sunny Funny's Polite Garden Party, he accepts
    Sunny Funny's invitation to a tea party and is the only one to actually
    eat what she made, as Katy would only keep talking and PaRappa starts
    reacting and thinking about what's going around him before actually
    trying to eat. He ends up being blown up by Sunny's Dyanmite Strawberry
    Onion Cake, but ends being full anyway. In Katy's Shopping Explosion,
    he asks Katy if he can get her a free pork chop after she wins the
    free shopping spree at the Massive Mart and helps her set up all the
    appliances she bought from there, and in PaRappa Gets a Job he sets
    him up for a job at the local game store, which PaRappa ends up liking
    a lot and being very good at even if the pay is low.
    </p>
    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper 2</h3>
    <p>
    PJ returns in the second PaRappa game, now with a much more involved
    role than in the previous games.
    </p>
    <p>
    Following the gane intro, he decides to follow Parappa to Beard
    Burgers in order for the two of them to get something to eat, and after
    Parappa makes burgers for Beard Burger Master they end up going to
    Parappa's home. It's here where he recommends Parappa the show <em>
    Romantic Karate</em>, and the two of them decide to watch it together.
    Following this, he gets hit with Papa PaRappa's shrinking ray alongside
    Parappa himself, but he, alongside Parappa's dad, General Potter, Katy,
    Lammy and all the guests that had come into the house who Ma-san shrunk
    with the remote control return to normal size after PaRappa raps with
    Guru Ant, who also ends up getting bigger.<br>
    Shortly after these events, PaRappa and PJ end up enlisting for the
    army under General Potter's command, and following their rather quick
    training session they end up having their first mission at the hair
    salon. PJ comments on the idea of Sunny wearing an afro, which PaRappa
    objects to.
    </p>
    <p>
    In the penultimate stage, he ends up joining the show as DJ PJ in
    order to support PaRappa against Colonel Noodles and also appears in the
    Final Party.
    </p>
    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper (2001 anime)</h3>
    <p>
    In the anime, where most of the cast seems to be younger, his
    personality is slightly different. He is more stoic and grumpy than
    in the original games and while he's always had interests in food and
    sleeping, these seem to be his main traits in the anime. He is still
    one of Parappa's best friends, and frequently hangs out with him and
    Matt.
    </p>
    <h3>PJ Berri's Munching Mumbling</h3>
    <p>
    PJ is the main protagonist of this spin-off anime, which is inspired
    by PJ Berri's Dreamland.<br> In this miniseries, he's the fortune teller
    at Chop Chop Master Onion's Fruits Cafe, with PaRappa interpreting his
    dreams in order to give their clients advice.
    </p>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
      PJ's favorite foods are donuts and peanut butter.
      </li>
      <li>
      It's unknown on whether PJ is naked or clothed. He looks like
      he's naked, but his RodneyFun bio implies he's clothed. In his
      writing for the KIDROBOT photo essay made to promote plushies of
      him and Sweety in Whimsyload, he mentions that not even he knows
      which one of them is true. He also claims that he only sometimes
      has fingers. He, however, does not wear shoes.
      </li>
      <li>
      PJ is Rodney's favorite character, as he has mentioned in
      interviews that he lives the kind of relaxed life he wished he had,
      and that while he found the idea of him as a DJ funny at first, he
      only started liking him even more after discoving he was indeed
      going to be a DJ.
      </li>
      <li>
      PJ has his own set of desktop accessories, appropiately named
      PJ Berri's Desktop Playground. It's smaller than Parappa on Screen
      and especially PaRappa Desktop Accessories, but it was purely made
      by Rodney and also features the first appearance of Sweety Bancha.
      </li>
      <li>
      PJ might be kind of a womanizer, as Sweety mentions in the
      A Day in New York City photo essay that she had to keep vigilating
      PJ in order to prevent him from flirting with another woman.
      </li>
