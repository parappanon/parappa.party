    <h3>Translated</h3>
    <p style="width:600px;">
    Sunny Funny is spirited and very postive. She has a lovely collection 
    of teacups and A-line dresses. A girl that loves cooking, she loves 
    making pasta and cakes; calls her friends to her tea parties and 
    often respond.<br>
    Gardening is the basis of her life, looking after the flowers every 
    day her routine.
    </p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>
    Sunny Funny is an anthropomorphic flower, most resembling a cross 
    between a sunflower and a daisy.<br>
    She has a yellow body, with her petals sprouting out of her head as 
    if they were hair.<br> 
    In her sprites and the anime, her eyes are blue, but in official 
    art they're black like everyone else's.
    </p>

    <p>She usually wears a one-piece dress with red and blue stripes 
    alongside green shoes.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>
    Sunny Funny's personality is quite incosistent between entries.
    </p>

    <p>In the games, Sunny is shown to be a fairly mysterious person 
    despite her importancy - while she's outgoing and confident, yet blunt 
     - the game being from PaRappa's 
    perspective means that we're kept in the dark regarding her for a 
    long time.<br>
    It isn't until PaRappa 2's Come a Long Way music video where we get 
    to see who really is - a kind girl who feels bad whenever the worst of 
    her shows and works hard to keep her bonds agreeable.
    </p>

    <p>In the anime, Sunny's personality is a lot more straightforward -
    she's cheerful, friendly, caring and hard-working, as well as the 
    heart of the group, mediating whenever any of them gets in conflict 
    with each other.<br>
    </p>

    <p>In the comics, her personality is shown to have traits of both, 
    with an special emphasis on what she considers to be being polite - 
    the secret to how she manages to be good at gardening and fishing.
    <br>
    In addition, despite her love of cooking, her plates are considered 
    to be disgusting due to her ecletic choice of ingredients. However, 
    her friends are always glad to go to her eating parties regardless.
    </p>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sunny Funny does have a mother.
        She has only appeared in promotional material for RodneyFun 
        collaborations, however, most notably the 1997 Waku Waku Tokyu
        one, where she's alongside General Potter in the background.
         </li>
        <li>
          PaRappa has rejected her cooking at least twice - first in 
          Sunny Funny's Polite Garden Party where she gives everything 
          she serves him to the squirrels, then in PaRappa 2's intro 
          after serving him noodles.
