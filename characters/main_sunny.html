    <h3>Translated</h3>
    <p style="width:600px;">
    Sunny Funny is spirited and very postive. She has a lovely collection 
    of teacups and A-line dresses. A girl that loves cooking, she loves 
    making pasta and cakes; calls her friends to her tea parties and 
    often respond.<br>
    Gardening is the basis of her life, looking after the flowers every 
    day her routine.
    </p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>
    Sunny Funny is an anthropomorphic flower, most resembling a cross 
    between a sunflower and a daisy.<br>
    She has a yellow body, with her petals sprouting out of her head as 
    if they were hair.<br> 
    In her sprites and the anime, her eyes are blue, but in official 
    art they're black like everyone else's.
    </p>

    <p>She usually wears a one-piece dress with red and blue stripes 
    alongside green shoes.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>
    Sunny Funny's personality is quite incosistent between entries.
    </p>

    <p>In the games, Sunny is shown to be a fairly mysterious person 
    despite her importancy - while she's outgoing and confident, yet blunt 
     - the game being from PaRappa's 
    perspective means that we're kept in the dark regarding her for a 
    long time.<br>
    It isn't until PaRappa 2's Come a Long Way music video where we get 
    to see who really is - a kind girl who feels bad whenever the worst of 
    her shows and works hard to keep her bonds agreeable.
    </p>

    <p>In the anime, Sunny's personality is a lot more straightforward -
    she's cheerful, friendly, caring and hard-working, as well as the 
    heart of the group, mediating whenever any of them gets in conflict 
    with each other.<br>
    </p>

    <p>In the comics, her personality is shown to have traits of both, 
    with an special emphasis on what she considers to be being polite - 
    the secret to how she manages to be good at gardening and fishing.
    <br>
    In addition, despite her love of cooking, her plates are considered 
    to be disgusting due to her ecletic choice of ingredients. However, 
    her friends are always glad to go to her eating parties regardless.
    </p>

     <h2>Appearances</h2>
    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper</h3>
    <p>
      In the first PaRappa game, Sunny plays a rather minimal yet very 
      important role as PaRappa's object of affection.<br>
       </p>

    <p>At the beginning of the game, she stops some bullies from getting
    involved with Parappa and the rest of her friends, attracting the 
    attention of Joe Chin. This would lead to Joe Chin having an 
    interest on her in addtion to PaRappa himself.</p>

    <p>Her birthday also just happens to take place in the middle of this 
    game's events, which leads Katy to start planning a party for her 
    with PaRappa and PJ on the day before it.<br>
    Once it happens, the gang celebrates, with Joe Chin also coming in 
    as an uninvited guest.</p>

    <p>It is also in this day where Sunny starts noticing PaRappa's 
    interest on him, decided to watch the sunset together.<br>
    However, it is at this point that PaRappa starts really wanting to 
    pee, which leadss him to get on his car, with Sunny sitting next to 
    him, attracted to how manly his face seemed to be when holding it in.
    </p>

    <p>At the end, PaRappa invites her to go to Club Fun with him and 
    watches his performance.</p>

    <p>After finishing all stages in Cool Mode, a special scene where 
    Sunny and Katy dance for the audience is unlocked.</p>
    
    <h3>Um Jammer Lammy</h3>
    <p>
      Sunny doesn't have much of a role in Um Jammer Lammy, but we know 
      she was involved in working with the costumes for the MilkCan 
      concert behind the scenes.
       </p>
    <h3>RodneyFun Comic Collection</h3>
    <p>
      Sunny is one of the main characters of the RodneyFun Comic 
      Collection.
    </p>

    <p>Her first appearance is in PJ's Dreamland, where she gives PJ 
    a big pot of food she made for him. It, however, causes PJ to feel 
    sick and have a nightmare, causing PJ to ignore her when she
    appears alongside PaRappa in Club Fun.
    </p>

    <p>Her main comic is the self-titled Sunny Funny's Polite Garden
    Party, in where her daily routine of gardening and fishing is 
    expanded upon, as well as her personality: she loves cooking, but is 
    bad at it. However, she still tries her best and her friends still
    attend her parties whenever they can.<br>
    She cares deeply and sincerely for everyone and everything around
    her, which has made her earn the trust of the sentient plants of 
    PaRappa Town - a trust they don't seem to have towards just anyone -
    and the animals, too.
    </p>

    <p>

      <h3>PaRappa The Rapper 2</h3>
    <p>
      Sunny Funny plays a slightly larger role through PaRappa the Rapper 
      2, kickstarting the plot after cooking noodles for PaRappa.<br>
      His reaction to this is completely negative, and causes her to 
      call him a "baby" due to her dissappointment.
      </p>

    <p>As eventually seen in the Come a Long Way music video, however; 
    Sunny didn't intend to be so mean to PaRappa. She spends the time 
    that passed during the events of the game reflecting on this and 
    trying to get closer to Parappa - whom she eventually manages to 
    meet up with and apologize to after he redeems Colonel Noodle.</p>

    <p>Shortly after these events, PaRappa gets invited to make an 
    special performance at ClubFun, and Sunny is the one to encourage 
    him to go into the stage and just be himself while he's at it.</p>

    <p>Following this game. Parappa and Sunny become an official couple.
    </p>

    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper (2001 anime)</h3>
    <p>
      Sunny Funny is part of the 2001 anime's main cast.<br>
      In this entry, she hangs out more frequently with Katy and Paula 
      than with the boys, and while PaRappa is as interested in here as 
      he is in the games, she never really sees him as anything more 
      than a friend.<br>
      She, however, gets the spotlight placed on her more often than in 
      the games, with Episode 18 in particular focusing on her.
    </p>
    <h3>PJ Berri's Munching Mumbling</h3>
    <p>
    Sunny Funny makes a few apperances in PJ Berri's Munching Mumbling, 
    namely on PaRappa's episodes througout the first season thanks to her 
    status as PaRappa's girlfriend, with Sunny giving PaRappa a present 
    then kissing him on the cheek and PaRappa visiting her house, among 
    others.
    </p>

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sunny Funny does have a mother.
        She has only appeared in promotional material for RodneyFun 
        collaborations, however, most notably the 1997 Waku Waku Tokyu
        one, where she's alongside General Potter in the background.
         </li>
        <li>
          PaRappa has rejected her cooking at least twice - first in 
          Sunny Funny's Polite Garden Party where she gives everything 
          she serves him to the squirrels, then in PaRappa 2's intro 
          after serving him noodles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sunny Funny was, alongside PJ Berri and Katy Kat, one of the 
          first three PaRappa characters to be designed, having 
          originally been made for Rodney Alan Greenblat's RodneyFun 
          line of products. (Source: <a href="http://whimsyload.com/character-club/parappa-the-rapper/">Whimsyload, PaRappa the Rapper and Friends in the Character Club, Question #2</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          Sunny has been shown to be very physically strong for her 
          size, with her being not only just capable of carrying 
          stacks of boxes and ricebags that most people would find 
          to be very heavy without much effort (as seen in page 10 
          of <em>Sunny Funny's Polite Garden Party</em>), but also 
          <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com/%21-RodneyFun/Rodney%20E-mails/tumblr_n232j3EBE81r1psj1o2_500.jpg">working out regularly as a way to keep this strength in her 
            body.</a>

          <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com/%21-RodneyFun/Rodney%20E-mails/tumblr_inline_mfh0z4JVJz1qm0kya.png">In an e-mail 
            featuring in-character replies written in 2012 by Rodney 
            Greenblat</a>, PJ Berri affirms that Sunny makes a "Holiday 
          Mush Roll" as their "winter holiday supper".
        </li>
        <li>
          In the same e-mail, Sunny also reveals that she uses the 
          Joe Chin product <em>Fresh'n Lively Petal Polish</em> in 
          order to keep her petals looking nice regardless of the 
          weather.
