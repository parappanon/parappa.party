    パラッパはかっこいいラップが大得意。何でもフリ付きのラップにして歌っちゃう生粋のラッパー。 サニーちゃんに夢中で、強ーいヒーローになってサニーちゃんの心をつかもうと何時も考えています。でも、こつこつ努力するのは大の苦手。テレビゲームマニアで、新作ゲームソフト情報にはかなり強いです。PJ とは大の親友。 
    <h3>Translated</h3>
    Parappa's cool raps are his strong point. Any show of his raps and 
    singing are like a natural-born rapper's.
    In Sunny-chan's dreams, he wants to become a strong hero who can 
    capture her heart at any time he can think of.
    However, he dreads doing such a laborious effort.
    He's obssesed with console games, and is quite good when it comes to 
    information about new games.
    PJ is his closest friend.
    </p>

    <h2>Phyisical Appearance</h2>
    <p>
    PaRappa is a small dog resembling a terrier or beagle.<br>
    He has cream or light yellow colored fur and black ears, which are 
    usually colored with the same color as the outline of his body.<br>
    His signature headpiece is an orange beanie, which is noted to have
    an eliptic patch of a frog in a yellow background.</p>

    <p>PaRappa has a variety of outfits, but his main one is a sleeveless 
    shirt with blue baggy pants.<br>
    </p>

    <p>He almost always wears the same red sneakers with white waves shaped
    like the letter "M" on the sides, the only exceptions being formal 
    ocassions and other situations where it wouldn't make sense for him 
    to wear them.</p>

    <p>He also has a pair of plaid pajamas with a matching hat, and he 
    has been seen wearing other outfits in the 2001 anime, such as 
    tuxedos and a karate uniform.</p>

    <p>In PJ Berri no Mogumogu Munyamunya, he replaces his usual shirt 
    for a long-sleeved one with white and navy horizontal sprites 
    alongside a grey apron - switching over to a yellow one featuring 
    the Chop Chop Fruits Cafe logo on the left front pocket.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Parappa is for the most part an outgoing and cheerful guy.
    </p>

    <p>He's easily moved by the things that happen to him, but just as 
    quick to pick up his own slack when there are problems to be solved,
    best said through his own catchphrase of "I gotta believe!" (ボクならできるさ！ in Japanese). This is because he knows himself and thus 
    believes he can do anything as long as he can push himself through 
    it.</p>

    <p>However, even PaRappa can falter sometimes, and when he does 
    end up feeling down, he becomes doubtful and nervous, requiring the 
    support of his friends and family to put himself back up.</p>

    <p>Another aspect of PaRappa is his ability to bring people together,
    as he's seen to be able to befriend others very quickly and help 
    people with all sorts of problems.<br>
    However, that doesn't mean he lets himself be walked over, as he 
    knows to distinguish what's right from wrong very well.</p>

    <p>Although PaRappa has a tendency to daydream, especially when it 
    concerns Sunny Funny, he doesn't let it overtake his life... for the 
    most part. Whenever he <em>does</em> get lost in fantasy, mishaps are 
    soon to follow.</p>

    <h2>Appearances</h2>
    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper</h3>
    <p>PaRappa is the main protagonist in the games titled after him.
       </p>
    <p>In this first game, he's introduced as a happy-go-lucky dog guy 
    who spends his time hanging around with his friends PJ Berri, Katy 
    Kat and Sunny Funny, whom he also has a crush on.</p>

    <p>The story starts when him and his friends, after watching Jet 
    Baby at the movies go to Chunky Burger. Stunned by Sunny, PaRappa 
    only manages to order a glass of water.<br>
    Soon after, however, they are harrassed by a group of bullies - but 
    Sunny tells them to stop it, which causes Joe Chin to suddenly 
    burst into the scene.<br>
    After defeating the bullies, Joe Chin proceeds to start rambling, 
    which causes everyone but PaRappa to leave. Instead, PaRappa starts 
    thinking of how to become a "hero", which leads him to find out 
    about Chop Chop Master Onion and his Fruits Dojo, kickstarting his 
    character arc.</p>

    <p>Throughout the game, Parappa ends up learning all sorts of new 
    skills and dealing with Joe Chin's involvement with Sunny Funny, 
    which culminates on the day of her birthday as he manamges to finally 
    spend some time with her... only to start desperately wanting to go 
    to the bathroom.</p>

    <p>This brings him into a panic as he starts driving to the gas 
    station in order to refuel both the car and himself - only to find 
    out that all of his previous teachers were also in line to use the 
    bathroom.<br>
    They allow Parappa to be first in line - but only if he raps against 
    them, which he accepts and succeeds.</p>

    <p>Some time after that, PaRappa receieves an invitation by a man  
    named Rodney to perform at Club Fun and to bring one other person 
    with him, which he accepts. In there he meets MC King Kong Mushi and
    performs with his teachers by his side.</p>
    <h3>Um Jammer Lammy</h3>
    <p>In Um Jammer Lammy, PaRappa cedes the main character status to 
    Lammy.<br>
    However, you can play the same stages (with the exception of Stage 1 
    on the original console version) as PaRaqppa after finishing the 
    main story mode.
      </p>

    <p>In PaRappa's story mode, we follow what PaRappa and his friends 
    did in the week leading to MilkCan's first concert.</p>

    <p>On Monday, PaRappa and friends find out about Katy founding 
    MilkCan and tell her if they can help her out.
    <br>
    Katy agrees, and gives Parappa and Sunny things to do, with 
    Parappa agreeing despite his initial reaction to Katy's demands 
    of carrying the equipment, buying snacks and giving them foot 
    massages on top of foot massages.</p>

    <p>On Tuesday, they start making up ideas for what the concert venue 
    will be like.<br>
    Parappa likes the outfit Sunny made, but PJ's idea of making the 
    concert venue resemble a piece of beef puts him on his nerves.</p>

    <p>On Wednesday, the gang reunites at Chunky Burger, and after 
    Parappa asks, Katy finally explains who the other two members 
    of MilkCan are to them.<br>
    Parappa and PJ, however, have very scary ideas of who Lammy and 
    Ma-san are and thus back into a corner.</p>

    <p>On Thursday, however; PaRappa and PJ decide to start their own 
    band.</p>

    <p>They visit the Maxi-Music store, finding out that Fleaswallow is 
    the one currently attending it. They ask for an instruments that fits 
    them, only to end up getting wooden agogogs, which they play as if 
    they were string instruments.</p>

    <p>And on Friday, they finally get a guitar.<br>
    Parappa and PJ decide to make some modifications to it - and end up 
    making a bigger wooden agogo out of the brand new guitar.</p>

    <h3>RodneyFun Comic Collection</h3>
    <p>
      PaRappa is one of the main characters in the RodneyFun Comic 
      Collection.
        </p>
    <p>His first appearance is in PJ's last dream in PJ's Dreamland, 
    where it turns out that the invading army on PJ's nightmare was an 
    army of PaRappa. AFter PJ wakes up, he actually sees PaRappa and 
    Sunny, causing him to leave.</p>

    <p>In Sunny Funny's Polite Garden Party, he accepts Sunny's 
    invitation to her party. However, Sunny's food turns out to be so 
    bad he ends up giving it all (including the drinks) to the squirrels.
    </p>

    <p>His actual story, however, is the self-titled PaRappa Gets a Job, 
    in where PaRappa struggles with employment after overhearing his 
    parents' concerns over his obsession with video games.<br>
    He works at Dot's Diner, the restaurant Katy works at first and 
    does well, but his curiosity and boredom start showing up as he eats 
    a cake that makes him sleep, leading him to quit after a single 
    day.</p>

    <p>The next day, he decides to ask Sunny for any places he can work 
    at instead. Sunny then manages to get him to work for Buttonose.<br>
    He works in the shop at first, but after an incident involving 
    a moody child and honey jars, Buttonose decides to make PaRappa a 
    delivery boy instead, which goes quite chaotically as PaRappa 
    struggles with all sorts of things regarding the customers he has 
    to deliver to and the places he has to go to in order to do so.<br>
    This leaves PaRappa fatigued, causing him to quit this job as well.
    </p>

    <p>After that, PaRappa calls PJ if he knows of any jobs.
    PJ tells him that he saw a "Help Wanted" sign at Techtom's Game 
    Cave, which interests PaRappa.<br>
    Once he's there, Techtom tells him that his job will be recommending 
    new games, which he agrees to.<br>
    Parappa then prvoes a hit with the customers, and while Techtom 
    can't pay him as much as his previous employers did, he lets Parappa 
    take a copy of any game and console he doesn't own yet, allowing 
    him to play even more games than ever.</p>

    <p>He also makes some cameo appearances in Katy's Shopping Explosion.
    </p>

    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper 2</h3>
    <p>After ceding the torch of main character to Lammy for the 
    previous game, PaRappa 2 once again gives the spotlight to <thead>
    eponymous characdter.
     </p>

    <p>It turns out that some time before the events of this game, 
    PaRappa won a 100-year supply of noodle products from Beard Burgers 
    alongside his father from a promotion.<br>
    At first, he loved this, but he eventually started getting tired of 
    only eating noodles - which came to a breaking point when he decided 
    to visit Sunny's house in order to eat something else... only for her 
    to make noodles as well.<br>
    This causes Parappa to get out of her house over it, with PJ 
    following him to Beard Burgers in search of something that is, well,
    not nooodles.
    </p>

    <p>Once he's at Beard Burgers, however, he finds out that they 
    are now only selling noodles due to a so-called "technical issue".
    <br>
    However, PaRappa's complaints about this lead to the legendary 
    founder of Beard Burgers, the Beard Burger Master himself to 
    return as a ghost and teach PaRappa how to make burgers.</p>

    <p>However, this doesn't mean all the shenanigans would end.<br>
    He manages to spend some time watching TV alongside PJ... only to 
    end up being shrunk by a malfunctioning Denoodlizer made by his 
    dad; causing him to meet Guru Ant.</p>

    <p>The day after, even more things happen - enlisting and training 
    in the Army, then finding an important item related to the noodles
    incident - the cartridge for the game Food Court, which he decides 
    to play for everyone after being warned of the consequences by his
    dad... and succeeding, finding out that, in fact, the real answer
    to noodles is sweets.</p>

    <p>Armed with this, the gang starts an all-out war with the Noodle 
    Syndicate and soon enough manage to storm through its headquarters.
    <br>
    After everyone realizes that the much feared Colonel Noodle was 
    just the heir to Beard Burgers, PaRappa decides to rap against him
    about food, managing to convince him that there's more to life than 
    just nooodles.</p>

    <p>In the end, PaRappa manages to stop having to eat noodles so 
    much, as well as the heart of Sunny Funny... only to end up getting 
    a hundred year supply of cheese instead. The answer to this cheesy
    problem is never revealed.</p>

    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper (2001 anime)</h3>
    <p>In the anime, PaRappa behaves in a way similar to that of the 
    game1s, but in a much more childish way.<br>
    He's also slightly shyer, and doesn't seem to use his usual 
    catchphrase yet, using <em>pishi!</em> (ピシ!) while holding 
    thumbs up in a similar manner instead.</p>
    </p>

    <h3>PJ Berri's Munching Mumbling</h3>
    <p>
    PaRappa reappears as one of the main characters in PJ Berri's 
    Munching Mumbling.<br>
    While having ceded protagonist status to PJ, PaRappa still plays an 
    important role in this series due to being his best friend, and has 
    a few episodes centering more on him, as well as his now-established
    relationship with Sunny Funny.
    </p>
    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The concept of PaRappa was initially created by Masaya
        Matsuura, who originally thought of him as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2017/04/04/interview-the-untold-story-of-parappa-the-rapper/">a character that raps for us"</a>.</li>
      <li>Parappa's species was not specific at first - considered species 
        for him include a shrimp, an onion, a clam, a pumpkin, a bee,
        a raven and a Godzilla-like creature until finally 
        settling down on a dog (source: PaRappa the Rapper 1 guidebook, 
        pages 86-87), which came to Rodney Greenblat after Matsuura and 
        script writer Gabin Ito told him they wanted a character who was 
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071112044706/http://uk.playstation.com/home/news/articles/detail/item74117/">"trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, romantic and a little insecure</a>.
      </li>
      <li>The original concept design of PaRappa as a dog was notably 
        different from the final one - he wore a backwards cap and looked 
        notably more smug.</li>
      <li>
          His color scheme is different between official/promo art and 
          the actual games - his fur color being more yellowish, his
          orangeorange hat more reddish and his shirt being indigo-colored 
          as opposed to  the sky-blue of the official illustrations.
          The anime uses the ingame color scheme.
       </li>
       <li>If Katy's thought about him on Sunny Funny's Polite Garden
         Party is to be believed, Parappa is considered to be short
         even in-universe, which would likely make PJ and Sunny short as 
         well.</li>
       <li>PaRappa's age is a bit of a question.<br>
         According to <a href="http://whimsyload.com/character-club/parappa-the-rapper/">Rodney Alan Greenblat's website Whimsyload</a>, there are 
         two possible answers to PaRappa's age - that he's "probably 18"
         in the games and younger in the anime due to being portrayed as 
         attending school, with Pinto possibly being in a lower grade; 
         and that he, as a fictional character doesn't need to have an 
         exact age.<br>
         The latter answer is more likely, however, given the dubious 
         canonicity  of the 2001 anime and Rodney having previously
         said <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/interview-rodney-greenblat-the-mother-of-sony-s-almost-mario">"in the game PaRappa could drive a car so you figure he's 16 or 17"</a>
         and referred to PaRappa as <a href="https://nodontdie.com/rodney-greenblat">
        "kind of like a young teenager"</a> on interviews released 
      years before the answer to the question about PaRappa's age was 
      added to Whimsyload, as well as official art made by him 
      celebrating the anniversary of PaRappa the Rapper (1996) referring 
      to it as PaRappa's birthday.</li>
       <li>Based on these images, we can also suppose that PaRappa's 
         birthday is on December 6th, making PaRappa the only character 
         in his universe to have an official birthday.</li>
       <li>
         <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060328051049/http://www.whimsyload.com/media.items/parappa/paraFrames.html">According to an older 
           version of the Whimsyload website</a>, PaRappa loves karate, 
         driving and flea markets, and isn't very fond of cooking or 
         being stuck in a car while wanting to go the bathroom.</li>
       <li>
         A small character resembling Parappa can be seen in <a href="https://x.com/NotParappanon/status/1780704212000923839">Page 17 of Rodney Greenblat's book Dharma Delight</a>, on the top section of the image, 
         second from the left.</li>
       <li>Parappa also actually appears alongside Sunny Funny in 
         <a href="https://x.com/p2a2r2a/status/1780769963415896258">another illustration in the book, this one in page 39.</a></li>
       <li>In an interview for THE FACE, Rodney Greenblat said that 
        if he was asked what kind of breed is Parappa's dog breed, it'd be
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070704094531/http://www.whimsyload.com/info.items/interviews2001.html#face">some sort of terrier</a>.
