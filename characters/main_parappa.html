    <h3>Japanese</h3>
    パラッパはかっこいいラップが大得意。何でもフリ付きのラップにして歌っちゃう生粋のラッパー。 サニーちゃんに夢中で、強ーいヒーローになってサニーちゃんの心をつかもうと何時も考えています。でも、こつこつ努力するのは大の苦手。テレビゲームマニアで、新作ゲームソフト情報にはかなり強いです。PJ とは大の親友。 
    <h3>Translated</h3>
    Parappa's cool raps are his strong point. Any show of his raps and 
    singing are like a natural-born rapper's.
    In Sunny-chan's dreams, he wants to become a strong hero who can 
    capture her heart at any time he can think of.
    However, he dreads doing such a laborious effort.
    He's obssesed with console games, and is quite good when it comes to 
    information about new games.
    PJ is his closest friend.

    <h2>Phyisical Appearance</h2>
    <p>
    PaRappa is a small dog resembling a terrier or beagle.<br>
    He has cream or light yellow colored fur and black ears, which are 
    usually colored with the same color as the outline of his body.<br>
    His signature headpiece is an orange beanie, which is noted to have
    an eliptic patch of a frog in a yellow background.</p>

    <p>PaRappa has a variety of outfits, but his main one is a sleeveless 
    shirt with blue baggy pants.<br>
    </p>

    <p>He almost always wears the same red sneakers with white waves shaped
    like the letter "M" on the sides, the only exceptions being formal 
    ocassions and other situations where it wouldn't make sense for him 
    to wear them.</p>

    <p>He also has a pair of plaid pajamas with a matching hat, and he 
    has been seen wearing other outfits in the 2001 anime, such as 
    tuxedos and a karate uniform.</p>

    <p>In PJ Berri no Mogumogu Munyamunya, he replaces his usual shirt 
    for a long-sleeved one with white and navy horizontal sprites 
    alongside a grey apron - switching over to a yellow one featuring 
    the Chop Chop Fruits Cafe logo on the left front pocket.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Parappa is for the most part an outgoing and cheerful guy.
       </p>
    <p>He's easily moved by the things that happen to him, but just as 
    quick to pick up his own slack when there are problems to be solved.</p>

    <h3>PaRappa The Rapper (2001 anime)</h3>
    <p>
    In the anime, where most of the cast seems to be younger, his
    personality is slightly different. He is mts ore stoic and grumpy than
    in the original games and while he's always had interests in food and
    sleeping, these seem to be his main traits in the anime. He is still
    one of Parappa's best friends, and frequently hangs out with him and
    Matt.

    <h2>Trivia</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Parappa's species was not specific at first - considered species 
        for him include a porcupine, a shrimp and an onion.
      </li>
      <li>The original concept design of PaRappa as a dog was notably 
        different from the final one - he wore a backwards cap and looked 
        notably more smug.</li>
      <li>
          His color scheme is different between official/promo art and 
          the actual games - his fur color being more yellowish, his
          orangeorange hat more reddish and his shirt being indigo-colored 
          as opposed to  the sky-blue of the official illustrations.
          The anime uses the ingame color scheme.
       </li>
       <li>If Katy's thought about him on Sunny Funny's Polite Garden
         Party is to be believed, Parappa is considered to be short
         even in-universe, which would likely make PJ and Sunny short as 
         well.</li>
    </ul>
