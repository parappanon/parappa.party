    <!-- Summary. <<- what are these things for???????? no shit this is what you see when you load the page! - wakfu[CK] -->
        <p>PaRappa the Rapper 2 is the sequel to the hit PlayStation game
        PaRappa the Rapper, developed by the same people who made the previous
        two games in the franchise and a few newcomers.<br>
        It released in August 30th of 2001 in Japan, January the 21st 2002 in
        North America and April 5th of that same year in Europe.
        </p>
        <p>It began development on the PlayStation 2 following the release of
        Um Jammer Lammy, and the time of accustomation to the new hardware and
        development platforms took quite a fair amount of the game's development
        time, but the team at NanaOnSha managed to make it work.</p>
        <p>While the game was still a commercial success in Japan due to
        the series' recognition as a brand, which made it enter the PlayStation
        2 the Best line only 10 months after its release, the disastrous
        production of the anime series, which was made to promote the franchise
        combined with the poor sales in the United States and near-complete
        lack of demand for the series in Europe led to PaRappa 2 being the last
        game in the series and most subsequent works related to the franchise
        being relesed in Japan only.</p>
