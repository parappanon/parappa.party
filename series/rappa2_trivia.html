    <!-- Summary. <<- what are these things for???????? no shit this is what you see when you load the page! - wakfu[CK] -->
    <h2>Did you know that...</h2>
    <p>
    <ul><li>Some of the voice actors from previous games were replaced
        with new ones for PaRappa 2? The most well known case is with
        Katy, but Sunny's voice actress was changed, too.</li>
        <li>There's a rare development and press kit made for E3's
        showcase of PaRappa 2 which includes some of the tracks from the
        game as well as concept art. However, it is very hard to find, and
        it hasn't been dumped yet either.</li>
        <li>In Japan there was a colalboration between PlayStation and McDonald's
        in the year 2001, which had happy meal toys, a trading card game and its
        own marketing campaign - as well as a "Happy Disc", which contained demos
        for both PaRappa 2 and the Ape Escape spin-off Piposaru 2001.</li>
        <li>The Happy Disc PaRappa 2 demo has quite a few changes from the
        original - namely the use of older assets for the scoring meters, as
        well as product placement for McDonald's through Beard Burgers.</li>

        <li>The Mexican magazine Atomix's 28th issue has PaRappa 2 as the
        cover game of the magazine, with a brand new illustration by Rodney
        Alan Greenblat in which Colonel Noodle kicks PaRappa, who is holding a
        bowl of noodles. Papa PaRappa, Sunny Funny and Chop Chop Master Onion
        are also present.</li>
        <li>There was a study in which PaRappa 2 was used in order to
        study how playing video games could affect the acqusition of foreign
        languages, in this case English learning for Japanese people.
