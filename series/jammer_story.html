    Um Jammer Lammy's intro starts with MilkCan going to the cinema
    to watch the sequel to Jet Baby. However, unlike in the previous game, this
    intro is used less to start the story and more to showcase the dynamics
    between MilkCan as a group, as well as Lammy's character in specific.
    After the movie ends, the three members have a debate on whether Jet Baby 2
    was better or worse than the original, and soon thereafter they go to Chunky
    Burger in order to get some snacks.<br> However, they get picked on by
    the Bullies, which leads to Katy giving Lammy her guitar, which shows
    Lammy's more confident side through her catchphrase "Leave it to Lammy!"
    </p>

    <p><h3>Now Wait a Minute? Who is That!?</h3>
    The game itself starts with Lammy rushing towards a concert she's
    participating on with her bandmates. As she rushes late, she starts
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-113734.png" align="right" height="150px">
    wondering on whether she should keep what happened before to herself or tell
    it to them, and ends up referencing Stage 5 of PaRappa 1, including the
    line "Let's rap for it!".</p>
    <p>
    Ultimately, she barely managed to make it - but only to find out that
    Katy has now invited Chop Chop Master Onion as the new vocalist for the
    band.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-120815.png" align="center" width="400px">
    <p>However, Katy notices her and gives Lammy her trademark guitar, which
    leads to <strong>Stage 1 - I Am A Master and You</strong>.</p>
    <p>Following the song, Lammy ends up becoming embarassed after finding out
    she had a vacuum cleaner in her hands all along.
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-120650.png" align="right" height="150px">
    Following that, Chop Chop Master Onion tells her that even if his dojo
    disappeared between the events of PaRappa 1 and UJL, he not only still
    fondly remembers it, but even imagines it in a even more glorious form
    that includes a <em>casino</em>.
    </p>

    <p><h3>B-back Off! You're in the Way!</h3></p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-115218.png" align="left" height="150px">
    <p>Soon after, Lammy touches her alarm and wakes up, glad
    that it was all just a dream.
    However, the real struggle is only to start, as she finds out that
    she only has 15 minutes left in order to get to the concert.</p>
    <p>This leads Lammy to go into a frenzy as she tries to get herself ready,
    having to go back to her apartment immediately after leaving it after
    realizing that she forgot to turn on the appliances.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-120929.png" align="left" width="200px">

    <p>Once she finishes turning off all of her appliances, Lammy finally exits
    her apartment in order to get to her concert, only to be stopped yet again,
    this time by external factors.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-115323.png" align="left" height="150px">
    <p>It turns out that the pizzeria is on fire, and while this unfortunate event
    has attracted a lot of people, Lammy has to cross the line as soon as
    possible in order to get to her concert in time.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-115333.png" align="left" width="200px">

    <p>The firefighters initally don't let her in, but after she explains her
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-115356.png" align="right" height="150px">
    situation to them, they let Lammy cross - but only if she helps them put
    the fire out.<br> She doesn't really want to do it at first, but after seeing
    a Joe Chin's Casino advertisement next to the burning building, she remembers
    Chop Chop Master Onion's words and decides to do it, starting <strong>Stage
    2 - Fire Fire!</strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-230427-115403.png" align="left" width="200px">
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-183641.png" align="right" width="200px">

    <p><h3>After School Sale</h3></p>
    <p>After the events of Stage 2, Lammy succeeds on her mission and she ends
    up eating pizza alongside the firefighting crew. In addition, Chief Puddle
    gives her a <strong>Flanger</strong>. However, Lammy checks on her clock and
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-220318-183440.png" align="right" height="150px">
    finds out that she now only has 11 minutes left for her concert.</p>
    <p>This leads Lammy to start rushing towards her concert, but due to the weight
    she's put on because of the pizze she can't go as fast as she wants, and to make
    things worse, she's now near a daycare and gets mistaken for pregnant by none
    other than the Daycare's nurse, Cathy Pillar. Lammy also sees families
    marching, and Cathy Pillar is quick to bring Lammy to the daycare, telling
    her that there's an after school sale today.
    </p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%28Japan%29-220318-183540.png" align="left" width="200px">

    <p>Lammy is then forcefully carried into the daycare, and she slims down
    after a few minutes, to which Cathy Pillar reacts negatively.<br>
    Cathy Pillar then forces Lammy to help her and everyone else at the daycare.
    She finds a casino roulette lying around, and like before, this reminds her
    of CCMO's words, leading to <strong>Stage 3 - Baby Baby!</strong>.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-183635.png" align="left" width="200px">
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-183641.png" algin="right" width="200px">
    <p><h3>Now Which One is My Left Hand?</h3></p>
    <p>Following Stage 3, Cathy Pillar vomits in front of Lammy while promoting
    the daycare, reminding her to come back "if she ever really has a baby".
    After this, Cathy gifts Lammy a <strong>harmonizer</strong>.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-185550.png" align="right" height="150px">
    Immediately after, however, Lammy is struck with reality and finds out that
    she now only has 8 minutes left until the show starts, leading her to another
    rush as she steals a skateboard off a pair of kids in order to go faster, and
    ends up seeing a plane nearby. Seizing opportunity, she sneaks in through
    one of the windows.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-185608.png" align="left" width="200px">
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-185613.png" align="right" width="200px">
    <p>After Lammy enters the plane, she notices the plane's pilot, Captain
    Fussenpepper. He turns around to see Lammy, but gets hit in the head during
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-185622.png" align="right" height="150px">
    the process, leading to his mad, constantly trigger-tempered side to yell at
    her for "being late", calling her a "soldier" during the process. However,
    shortly after this speech Fussenpepper gets hit in the head again, and goes
    back to his goofy, rather forgetful personality, telling Lammy about his new
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-185712.png" align="left" height="150px">
    fake teeth instead. The two keep bantering as Fussenpepper switches between
    his two sides courtesy of injuries to the head, but as a flight attendant
    announces that the plane is now about to take off, she mentions it has a
    casino, reminding Lammy of what CCMO said again, and Fussenpepper gets hit
    yet again as well, starting <strong>Stage 4 - Fright Flight!</strong></p>
    <p><h3>You Said Anything, Didn't Ya?</h3></p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-191859.png" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>After Stage 4, however, the 737 that Lammy and Fussenpepper were flying
    in ended up crashing into what seems to be a parking lot for a used car
    dealership. However, Lammy and Fussenpepper get out of the plane in time,
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-191912.png" align="left" height="150px">
    and Fussenpepper then uses this opportunity to gift his new fake teeth to
    Lammy, now working as the <strong>wahwah</strong> effect in-game.<br>
    But much like in earlier stages, Lammy is immediately reminded of the time
    she has left for the concert, which has now drastically decreased to only
    3 minutes, going off immediately to the concert...</p>
    <p>...until she realizes that she lost her guitar on the plane.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-191937.png" align="left" width="200px">
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-191954.png" align="right" width="200px">
    <p>This leads to a moment of desperation, but Lammy soon finds out that
    she's right in front of Chuck's Custom Guitars, to which she goes into.<br>
    Lammy tries to request Paul Chuck, who is the store owner a guitar, but her
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-195454.png" align="right" height="150px">
    flustered attempts don't convince him at first, but after telling him that
    she'd do <em>anything</em> for it he eventually accepts, which ends up
    actually scaring Lammy. As she tries to hide, Chuck eventaully finds her,
    and gives her his chainsaw. Lammy, despite being unsure of how much time
    she has left to make it, overhears the song Casino in my Hair and restores
    her confidence that way, starting <strong>Stage 5 - Power Off, Power On!
    </strong>
    </p>
    <p><h3>Vital Idol</h3></p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-200221.png" align="left" height="150px">
    <p>During stage 5, Lammy and Paul Chuck make a custom guitar together, and
    now Lammy has finally recieved the result of their work. In addition, Paul
    Chuck gifts Lammy a <strong>distortion</strong> effect. And much like in
    previous stages, Lammy is yet again reminded of the time left, which is now
    only <em>2 minutes</em>.</p>
    <h4>Version Differences</h4>
    <p>This stage is different depending on which version of Um Jammer Lammy you
    play.<br>
    In the Japanese and European versions of the game, Lammy dies and gets
    sent to hell, while in the American version, she instead ends up in a remote
    island. This change was done in order to appease to the ESRB and mantain an
    E rating. However, the version of events that will be described will be the
    canonical version of events, that is, what happened in the Japanese and European
    versions.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Lammy starts rushing her way into the destination yet again, but she soon
    steps on a banana peel falling down to her death.<br></p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-200306.png" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>Soon after, she wakes up somewhere... strange. Lammy wonders on where she is
    and breaks the 4th wall, then the credits start rolling until an agent,
    Jack Smash, finds her and brings her to a concert, as he thinks he finally
    found the guitarrist.</p>
    <p>Lammy is then introduced in the concert stage to the diva Teriyaki Yoko,
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-200350.png" align="left" height="150px">
    who yells at her for being late and threatens to kill her. However, after
    Lammy tells her that she's dead already, Yoko promises that she'll revive
    her instead, as long as she plays well - and without the need to remember
    CCMO's words, this promise motivates Lammy to turn into her confident guitarrist
    persona, with <strong>Stage 6 - Taste of Teriyaki</strong> starting after
    Yoko does a small countdown.</p>
    <p><h3>MILKCAN, That's Us!</h3></p>
    <p>After Lammy and Yoko finish playing Taste of Teriyaki, Yoko summons a fax
    machine, which would bring Lammy back to PaRappa Town. However, before she
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201644.png" align="right" height="150px">
    can use it, Lammy's edgier counterpart from hell, Rammy, comes from it, only
    to find out that the show was now over. Rammy, now mad at Lammy, accuses her
    of stealing her job and starts complaining about how everything she had is
    now broken. She offers Lammy a duel, but due to the lack of time Lammy
    refuses and hops on the fax machine instead, regardless of Rammy's
    insistence towards it.</p><br>
    <p>After returning back to PaRappa Town, Lammy sees a <strong>reverb
    </strong> with Yoko's face in it, and Lammy gives Yoko thanks for the gift,
    even if not in-person.</p>
    <p>As Lammy rushes to the concert, we see a flashback involving the entirety
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201723.png" align="left" height="150px">
    of MilkCan, with Katy announcing the live concert to the other 2 girls in
    a changing room. While initially excited, Lammy starts worrying about just
    how close the date is, but Katy tells that it's the reason why they have to
    start working on it.<br>
    Katy then starts giving costume ideas, from a cavewoman, to an astronaut to
    a painter, but neither Lammy or Ma-san seem particularly interested in either.
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201734.png" align="left" width="200px">

    <br>At this exact point, Lammy ends up getting electrocuted, and her look
    followinga that ends up being approved by both Katy, who's now dressing as
    a cowgirl and Ma-san.</p>
    <p>Following the theme idea, the trio starts working on the poster. Katy
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201754.png" align="right" height="150px">
    decides to make the logo really big, and Lammy suggests to her that "her
    picture doesn't have to stand out", even if Katy wants it to. Ma-san also
    decides to promote her father's pharmacy.</p>
    <p>After this, we go back to the current time, and as Lammy rushes, we find
    out that Katy and Ma-san were actually similarly late for the concert, which
    also surprises Lammy. As the three finally see each other, they all put their
    hand together and apologize to each other at the same time.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201809.png" align="left" width="200px">

    <p>Once the concert begins, Katy asks Lammy if she's okay, to with Lammy, now
    confident in herself responds by telling that MilkCan is always in her mind.
    The trio, in unison, then says "Leave it to... MILKCAN!" in front of the
    audience, starting the final stage of Lammy's campaign, <strong>Got to Move!
    </strong></p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201829.png" align="center" width="400px">
