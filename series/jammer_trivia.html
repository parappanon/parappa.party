        <li>
            Before the announcement of PaRappa The Rapper 2,
            Um Jammer Lammy was called by many as a "Parappa 2"
            of sorts, especialy when it came out. This was,
            coincidentally, also the development title for the
            game, as shown in <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Guidebooks/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20Official%20Guidebook/UJL_guide_90_91.png">concept</a>
            <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Guidebooks/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20Official%20Guidebook/UJL_guide_74_75.png">art</a>

            In August 26th of 1999, there was a launch party
            for the North American release of Um Jammer Lammy at
            the Roxy Nightclub in New York City, in where the voice
            actors for many of the characters that appeared in the
            game performed songs from both PaRappa The Rapper and Um
            Jammer Lammy. <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=6KcGAOaXkpQ">
            You can watch the Um Jammer Lammy at the Roxy concert here</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
            Rodney Greenblat himself found the difficulty of
            Um Jammer Lammy to be very hard.
        </li>

        <li>
            Due to the bigger budget compared to the previous game,
            there were commercials made to promote Lammy in Japan.
            One of the more notable ones was <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=t1qIwc5dhXc">
            a short advertisement where Parappa is watching TV and falls in love with
            Lammy after seeing her face on TV</a>, which is really weird due to the
            fact that Parappa's main and only love interest in the games
            is Sunny Funny.

        <li>
            For a long time, the arcade version of Um Jammer Lammy, which is
            called Um Jammer Lammy NOW! was considered lost media. However, a
            real cabinet is confirmed to exist, and footage of many of the
            arcade-exclusive cutscenes such as the MilkCan interviews, Joe Chin
            commercials and music videos have shown up on the internet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stage 1 of PaRappa's story mode has <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=aYAklA1DQwg">
            a small clip</a> based on the cutscenes for that stage focusing on PJ
            Berri with a instrumental version of "All You Need is Music".
        </li>
        <li>
            Quite a few expressions shown in the FMV cutscenes,
            <a href="../images/series/ram.png">most notably with Rammy</a>
            are not present in the in-game models for the respective
            characters.<br>
            In addition, Lammy has three-dimensional feet on the FMVs, but
            is rendered completely flat ingame.</li>
            <img src="../images/series/lammymodels.png" alt="Lammy's feet in FMVs and ingame" align="center" width="350px">
        <li>
            In Stage 6, if you notice the enviroment surrouding Lammy,
             <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-200253.png">
            you can see PJ walking while eating a banana at the moment
            Lammy's ghost leaves her body</a>. Some people have theorized
            that this means that PJ was the one who accidentally killed
            Lammy due to his gluttonous eating habits.
        </li>
        <li>
            In stage 7, you can see <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(1999)/Screenshots/Cutscenes/Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20(Japan)-220318-201720.png">Sweety Bancha
            sitting in the background
            during one of the flashback cutscenes</a>. This cameo is the
            only appearance Sweety has ever had in any of the games.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are more than a few references to the original PaRappa
            the Rapper across the game - Lammy recalls the events of the
            orgiinal game's fifth stage at the very start of the game and
            at the start of the cutscene prior to Power Off, Power On!,
            we see a big parking lot where the cars are organized in rows
            whose sections are separated by signs showing the faces of
            PaRappa 1's masters.
