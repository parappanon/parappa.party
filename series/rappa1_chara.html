            <h2>PaRappa and Friends</h2>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_parappa.png"
                wrap="wrap" align="left" height="200px">
            <p><strong>PaRappa:</strong> The hip hop hero of the series.
            He's an energetic dog who wants to win the heart of his crush,
            Sunny Funny, but has to overcome multiple challenges to do so.
            He never gives up, and his catchphrase is "I gotta believe!".</p>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_sunny.png"
                 wrap="wrap" align="right" height="200px">
            <p><strong>Sunny Funny:</strong> An anthropomorphic flower who is
            also PaRappa's crush and eventual love interest with a bright
            personality. She loves gardening and cooking, although she is
            terrible at the latter.</p>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_pj.png"
                 wrap="wrap" align="left" height="200px">
            <p><strong>PJ Berri:</strong> One of PaRappa's best friends.
            While he's usually laid-back, eating and sleeping his way through
            life, his cool DJ PJ persona comes through once the night starts.
            </p>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_katy.png"
                 wrap="wrap" align="right" height="200px">
            <p><strong>Katy Kat:</strong> Another of PaRappa's closest friends.
            She's a very fashionable cat who acts like the big sister of PaRappa's
            group and enjoys fashion, shopping and poetry.</p>
            <h2>The Rival</h2>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_joechin.gif"
                 wrap="wrap" align="left" height="200px">
            <p>The narcisstic heir of a immensely large business conglomerate,
            and PaRappa's rival for the affection of the lovely Sunny Funny.
            He is very wordy and very willing to do exaggerated antics, which
            drives many away from him.</p>

            <h2>The Teachers</h2>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_ccmo.png"
                 wrap="wrap" align="left" height="200px">
            <p><strong>Chop Chop Master Onion:</strong> The one and only karate
            teacher of the Fruits Dojo, and the first teacher PaRappa meets in
            the game. He is a very composed man, and is admired and respected
            by his disciples.</p>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_mooselini.gif"
                 wrap="wrap" align="right" height="200px">
            <p><strong>Instructor Mooselini:</strong> The mean driving
            instructor at U-Drive-U, from a family of similarly mean instructors.
            Due to this, she has very high standards for whether someone can
            pass her test or not.</p>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_fleaswallow.gif"
                 wrap="wrap" align="left" height="200px">
            <p><strong>Prince Fleaswallow:</strong> The owner of PaRappa Town's
            flea market. He comes from Jamaica, and can be considered to be a
            hippie due to his dressing and mannerisms. He also thinks he can
            sell any kind of junk possible.</p>
            <img src="../images/characters/ptr_cheapcheap.gif"
                 wrap="wrap" align="right" height="200px">
            <p><strong>Cheap Cheap the Cooking Chicken:</strong> The host of a
            popular cooking show on TV, who helps PaRappa make a cake.<br>

            it.</p>

            <p><strong>MC King Kong Mushi:</strong> The most beloved MC in all
            of PaRappa Town. When he rises upon the stage, it turns into a big
            funky party. He is also looked up to by PaRappa.</p>
