        <p>Development took another two years due to the move to the then
        new PlayStation 2, and this caused not only many issues as minor yet
        important as the models' shadows not working, but also for some things
        to have been scrapped, such as the co-op mode.<br>
        In addition, the new hardware also allowed for the game's cutscenes to
        be rendered in real time as opposed to using FMVs, and Matsuura wanted
        to use this as an opportunity to allow the players to edit these
        cutscenes if they wanted to, but this idea was scrapped as well.</p>

        <p>Much like in the previous games, Gabin Ito wrote the storyline for
        PaRappa 2 with Matsuura's oversig and Rodney Greenblat designed the
        characters. Due to the zanier plot. Rodney had a harder time getting the
        character designs right. For example, the namesake and theme of Beard
        Burgers was based on Gabin Ito's idea of Beard Burger Master being
        German.</p>
        
        <p>When it came to promotion, however, PaRappa 2 was marketed just
        as much, if not even more than previous titles. In Japan alone, not
        only were collaborations with companies such as McDonalds made, but an
        anime adaptation was outright announced in order to further promote the
        game.<br>
        Meanwhile, in the West a hip-hop themed ad campaiugn was created in
        order to market the game in the United States, and press kits featuring
        the game were made for both the North American and European regions in
        order to show the game at expositions and as assets for the gaming
        press.</p>

             alt="A print ad promoting PaRappa 2 in the US" width="400px">

        <p>However, this promotion didn't help much, as PaRappa 2's reviews
        in gaming magazines and websites alike across the West mostly agreed on
        it being bare and old-hat, while the constant excecutive meddling and
        troubled production of the anime led it to become a flop in Japon, with
        multiple stations dropping the show after 17 episodes.<br>
        This one-two punch situation caused the franchise to go on a status
        of limbo following the anime's end, and no new game in the PaRappa The
        Rapper franchise has ever been announced since then.</p>
