    <!-- Summary. This should be what you see when you first enter this page -->
        <p>Um Jammer Lammy NOW! is the arcade verson of Um Jammer Lammy, which
        was originally playtable in arcades across Japan through the year of
        1999.<br>
        The arcade machines were developed by Namco, running a modified version
        of its System 12 arcade platform that allows the game to (partially)
        run off a CD drive.</p>

        <p>Um Jammer Lammy NOW! has many differences from the original home
        release of Um Jammer Lammy, most notably the use of guitar controllers
        specfically made for it rather than the PlayStation's DualShock,
        Parappa being playable on the 1st stage and many new cutscenes that
        were never present in the original game.</p>

        <p>Following its release, Um Jammer Lammy now was rolled out at arcades
        and conferences all across Japan, most notably the 1999 Tokyo Game Show,
        but the only known surviving machine to this day is owned by a British
        celebrity.</p>
