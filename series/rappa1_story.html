            <p>PaRappa the Rapper starts with a scene of the movie "Jet Baby",
            which the characters are watching at the cinema. After Jet Baby
            defeats the one-eyed monster and saves a teddy bear, the credits
            start rolling, and we are introduced to PaRappa and his friends.</p>

            <p>They talk about Jet Baby while on their way to the nearby Chunky
            Burger, and once they enter the establishment the gang starts
            requesting what they want to eat.</p>
            <p>While Sunny is ordering, Parappa starts staring at her, and he
            ends up getting so distracted by her appearance that he is reminded
            to order something, but ends up only requesting for water.</p>

            <p>While PaRappa and his friends are eating, a group of bullies
            enter the establishment and approach the table, starting to harrass
            the gang. However, Sunny tells them to stop, and soon after Joe
            Chin comes out of one of the bathroom stalls, with a comically
            exaggerated introduction included.<br>

            Joe then proceeds to start lauding his accomplishments at the bullies,
            which starts tiring them, and as Joe starts outright talking too
            much (which is demostrated by all the text bubbles surrounding him)
            PJ, Katy and Sunny get

            bored of him as well, leaving the restaurant in order to do something
            else.</p><br>
            <p>PaRappa, however, stays for a bit longer as Joe Chin's speech
            instead starts motivating him to become a hero, too. He gets an
            idea, leading to the first canonical instance of "I gotta believe!"
            in the series.</p>

            <p>Finally, we get introduced to the karate master Chop Chop Master
            Onion, teacher of the Fruits Dojo, which starts the first stage of
            the game - Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap.</p>

            <p>After the end of the first stage, we go back to Joe Chin, who
            finally finishes his introduction, knocking out the bullies after
            several hours of talking.</p>
            <h2>You Guys Sit in the Back</h2>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-201125.png" align="right" height="150px">
            <p>Some time passes, and for the day PaRappa and friends are at
            Phat Donut. Sunny asks them where they want to go while they're
            eating.</p>
            and PaRappa suggests going to the beach, to which they
            agree. Katy reminds them that they'd need a car to do that, to which
            PJ adds a driver's license.<br>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-201206.png" align="left" height="150px">
            It's in this moment when Joe Chin arrives at the donut shop with his
            awe-inducing Super Stretched Limo 900, which he shows off to the gang.
            He asks the girls if they want to go to the beach with him,
            and Sunny accepts, but only and only if he brings everyone there.
            Joe accepts and allows Sunny and Katy to be in the front seats, while
            forcing PaRappa and PJ to sit on the backseats to their disssappointment,
            which due to the convertible's length is very far from the front
            seats.</p>

            <p>When Joe Chin is ready to drive the gang to the beach, he almost
            immediately crashes his car into Phat Donut, leading PaRappa and PJ
            fainting and with lots of donuts to eat, but Joe moves his car without
            thinking of any of the consequences quickly after.
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-201307.png" align="left" height="150px">
            <br>It's at this point that PaRappa starts imagining how it'd be like
            to fly Sunny to somewhere, and starts wondering of how it would be
            like if he just had a car and a license, leading him to utter his
            catchphrase.</p>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-201331.png" width="200px" align="right">
            <p>After this, we are introduced to Instructor Mooselini, who is the
            driving instructor for U-Drive-U, starting Stage 2 of the game.</p>
            <p>After Stage 2 ends, we see PaRappa's driver's license, included
            with a funny face.</p>

            <p>We get another glimpse of PaRappa's driver's license, this time
            with a proper picture of him smiling, which quickly cuts into a
            scene where PaRappa takes off to Phat Donuts on his dad's car regardless of his
            father's worries.<br> He soon makes it there and shows his dad's car
            to the gang, and then invites his friends for a ride, with Sunny of
            course being on the front seats alongside him.</p>

            <p>While driving, Sunny tells PaRappa if they could go somewhere
            "far, far away", which leads the dog to start imagining how a
            romantic dinner date with Sunny would go. As he starts daydreaming
            of kissing her, a heavy load truck ends up pushing PaRappa's dad's
            car, sending the gang to space (Katy even takes a picture!) and
            destroying it.</p>

            <p>This event leads PaRappa to despair yet again as he
            fears his father will find out about what happened, but he reminds
            himself to believe in himself again.</p>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-202049.png" align="right" height="150px">
            <p>Finally, we get introduced to the third stage's teacher, Prince
            Fleaswallow, the owner of a flea market PaRappa is planning to work
            on, who tells the player that the key to selling well is love and
            encourages them to freestyle as well.</p>
            <h2>Guaranteed to Catch Her Heart</h2>
            <p>Some time has yet again passed from the events of Stage 3, and
            it's now the day before Sunny Funny's birthday.<br>

            At Phat Donut, the gang's usual hangout, Katy is starting to plan what
            things will each of the other three will do for her birthday, and
            she's deciding this through rock-paper-scissors. The roles are three
            - someone who gets a present for her, someone who's going to buy the
            cake for her and and someone that will set up where it'll be and if
            there are going to be any decorations.<br>

            After the first round, Katy becomes the set-up producer, showing off
            a business card showing so.<br>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-204423.png" align="left" height="150px">
            In the next round, PaRappa and PJ play against each other, but end up
            both rolling paper, so they do it again; and this time around PJ rolls
            scissors, which means he's now the one who has to get the present.
            This leads PaRappa to now having to buy the cake.</p>
            <p>PaRappa enters Sweety Cakes, the local bakery and cake store, and
            while checking what they have on display around he starts thinking
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-204756.png" align="right" height="150px">
            of whether to get the "Total Love" cake or the "Daisy" one. He ends
            up choosing the "Daisy" one because he thinks Sunny would like it,
            although given the much higher price of the other cake it might have
            also played a factor in that way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Soon after leaving the store, however, PaRappa is faced with a
            surprise...</p>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-204825.png" width="400px">
            <p>...it turns out that Joe Chin <em>also</em> got a cake for Sunny,
            and it's also much bigger, with an impressive 42 floors!<br>
            Joe then proceeds to verbosely explain what every floor of the cake
            means to PaRappa, and tells him that he's going to explain it in
            <em>even more detail</em> the day after before leaving and pushing
            PaRappa down, making him drop his cake and his face on the cake -
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-204922.png" align="left" height="150px">
            leading him to imagine what Katy would think of him if he didn't
            bring a cake to the party, and since he's not only almost out of
            money, but also of time.</p>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-204932.png" align="right" width="200px">
            <p>This means PaRappa is particularly thinking about a cake
            he can have for cheap - which leads to him to utter his catchphrase
            yet again as he is reminded of Cheap Cheap's cooking show, which he
            signs up for in order to be able to bake a cake for Sunny and starting
            Stage 4 of the game.</p>

            <p>It is now the day of Sunny's birthday. PaRappa brings the seafood
            cake that he made with Cheap Cheap in Stage 4 to the picnic party
            and has a very fun time with his friends, chatting and eating
            together. PaRappa in particular eats a lot of the seafood cake, and
            when Joe Chin comes to the party with his huge cake, he is ignored
            despite all his attempts to join the gang.<br>
            Later on, PaRappa tells Katy if he can spend some time alone with
            Sunny, to which she accepts, with her and PJ leaving them so they
            can be togehter, looking at the sunset.</p>
            <p>While together, however, as PaRappa is feeling hopelessly in love
            while romantically watching the sunset, he starts feeling some urges
            that tell him to go to the bathroom, which frustrates him.</p>

            <p>As he starts thinking about how much he needs to do so, he starts
            seeing toilets over the birds flying in the sky, and he blames his
            issue on all the cake he ate.<br>At this point Sunny Funny notices
            him, realizing how manly he seemed to look, and she asks him if he
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220725-205942.png" align="left" height="150px">
            can give her a ride, which he approves to - especially since he really
            needs to go to the bathroom. PaRappa puts on some music, and as he
            drives into somewhere he can find a bathroom on, he finds out that
            his car's gas tank is empty - which means he now also has find a gas
            station, which he does after driving straight for enough minutes.</p>

            <p>He also finds out that the gas station has a restroom, and runs
            straight into it hoping to relieve himself - just to find out that
            all of his previous teachers are in line to the bathroom as well,
            leading PaRappa to disssappointment. However, the teachers tell him
            that they <em>do</em> know, and challenge him to a rap battle if he
            wants to be first in line and starting the penultimate stage of the
            game. Parappa wins, and soon after finally relieves himself.</p>

            <p>Parappa wins, and soon after finally relieves himself. However,
            after returning to the car so he can drive Sunny home, she notes
            that he's "the same old PaRappa again".</p>
            <h2>I Gotta Believe!!</h2>
            <p>PaRappa's dad recieves an invitation from a man named "Rodney"
            directed to PaRappa himself to go to Club Fun with one other person.
            After PaRappa reads it, he starts thinking of inviting Sunny Funny,
            and he calls her in order to ask her out, which she accepts.<br>
            The day of the party, PaRappa drives to Sunny's house in order to
            go out with her, and once he gets there he walks to the door and
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220726-185838.png" align="left" height="150px">
            rings the doorbell - only to be shocked by seeing Sunny's father
            instead, with his daugther behind him. Sunny explains everything to
            him and he accepts, but PaRappa must bring her home at a certain
            time.</p>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220726-185916.png" align="right" height="150px">
            <p>After that, they drive together to Club Fun and are welcomed by
            Katy, who is going to dance there. PaRappa and Sunny advance into
            the crowd, and it seems that everyone is there, even Joe Chin and
            the bullies and we also find out that PJ is the DJ. After this,
            however, PaRappa and Sunny part ways, as he is invited to perform
            with MC King Kong Mushi, starting the sixth and final stage of the
            game.</p>
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220726-185933.png" width="400px">
            <br>
            <p>After finishing the game, we get a final scene where while the rest
            of the people in the cinema have left the room, PaRappa and friends
            go into it, and as the camera zooms into the screen we are welcomed
            with the words "The End". This leads to the credits scene, which
            finishes with a small segment that teases a possbile sequel.</p>
