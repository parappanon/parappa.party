            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p>The history of PaRappa The Rapper dates back to 1993, when
            Masaya Matsuura, then the founder and leader of the band Psy-S
            creates the company NaNaOnsha in order to work on video games after
            the success of his first CD-ROM The Seven Colors - Legend of PSY-S
            City.</p>
            <p>Somewhere around that time, the aspiring American artist Rodney
            Alan Greenblat met an agent from a company called Interlink named
            Taki Wayoshi. Wayoshi represented American illustrators, and Rodney
            quickly accepted the job. His very first job as an artist aiming at
            a Japanese audience was a poster for Sony's Handycam, which ended up
            becoming extremely successful, leading to the beginning of his
            popularity in Japan.</p>
            <img src="../images/series/dazzeloids.png" alt="Dazzeloids (1994)"
            align="right" height="200px">
            <p>In 1994, Rodney released his CD-ROM storybook Dazzeloids for the
            Mac, and he decided to show it at a Mac conference in Tokyo, which
            became a hit among the attendants there too, which convinced him to
            create a Japanese version of it.</p>
            <p>In that exact same year, Masaya Matsuura got the original idea
            for PaRappa the Rapper - a music game starring a cute, wacky
            protagonist out of a whim, and confident in taking some
            bets, he decided to tell various video game companies about it,
            including Sony, which would show itself to be the most receptive to
            the idea, especially since Matsuura felt that the PlayStation was
            the best system to make the game for.<br>
            ...And it just happened that around the same time, Rodney had just
            gotten a contract with Sony Creative Products, a licensing division
            of Sony through his contact with Wayoshi, and Sony Creative Products
            <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Concept%20Art/p7.charctrs.gif"
            alt="Concept art featuring Katy, Pony Pony, PJ and PaRappa"
            align="right" height="100px">
            wanted Rodney to create some characters to create merchandise with
            - leading to the creation of the characters PJ Berri, Sunny Funny,
            Katy Kat and a fourth character named Pony Pony that didn't really
            make the cut to the final game.</p>
            <h2>Two Creators Meet</h2>
            <p>While Matsuura had planned the game to be illustrated by Rodney
            after presumably learning about Dazzeloids, and his wife, Kiri, who
            was an artist herself knew about Rodney's work from his storybooks,
            it was nothing but a surprise to Rodney when he got a call from Sony
            Computer Entertainment (SCEI) about Matsuura's plans for what would
            end up becoming PaRappa The Rapper.<br>
            When Rodney went to SCEI's headquartes, he ended up being completely
            amazed by the dinosaur head tech demo that the people there showed
            him.<br>
            After that, he was asked to be the designer for the new game that was
            on the planning works, but refused because he didn't really think he
            was sure that his own art was going to look good on 3D - but following
            that, Matsuura said to him "No, no, we want to do it in 2D. We want
            to have 2D characters running around in a 3D world", referring to
            the 'paper thin' art style Matsuura had in mind for the game.<br>
            This idea was accepted by everyone on the team, including Rodney
            himself.</p>
            <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>Following this, it was time for Rodney to start working on the
            characters as Matsuura's team started working on the game.<br>
            First, Sony Creative Products licensed the four characters that
            Rodney had made for the RodneyFun merchandise line to SCEI, which
            meant that Matsuura could use them for the game.
            PaRappa, the main character himself was created with the idea of
            someone that was 'cute, faithful and loyal', and while originally
            intended to be of another species, Rodney quickly came up with
            the idea of making him a dog, to which Matsuura agreed on.</p>

            width="400px" alt="The evolution of PaRappa, as seen
            in the magazine Tips and Tricks">
            <p>After PaRappa's design was done, the rest of the cast was created,
            including the teachers and side characters. Sometimes Matsuura had
            the original idea of how they'd be like and Rodney would try to make
            the design represent it, like with Instructor Mooselini, sometimes
            Ito had a clear idea of the character's appearance and Rodney had
            to match it, and sometimes Rodney just guessed how the character
            would be based on what they did, most notably with Chop Chop Master
            Onion, whose design was based on the "Onion Rappa" shown in the
            PaRappa concept designs.<br>
            Names were concepted in a similar way, as sometimes Matsuura came
            up with the names, such as with PaRappa himself, while in others
            Rodney was the one who gave the characters their names, like with
            Prince Fleaswallow.</p>
            <p>The team for PaRappa the Rapper at NanaOnSha was very small,
            consisting of about 10-12 people, including Rodney, Matsuura, Ryu
            Watabe, the songwriter who helped Matsuura with the raps, the story
            writer Gabin Ito, 3-4 programmers and voice actors, but development
            ultimately went along.</p>
            <p>The game went through a lot of changes on its design and
            programming through its development, as the game mecahnics which
            the series would build on in the next two entries were built up and
            Rodney's designs were perfected, as you can see in the following
            videos which were made during the game's production and uploaded by
            Rodney Greenblat to Youtube</p>

            <h2>After The Game was Done</h2>
            <p>After the game was finished being worked on, some team members
            said that they didn't think PaRappa was a "real game", and even
            Matsuura was confused about it. Two entire years of hard work and
            many hardships that had come along the way, from the distrust from
            others about the game, to the lack of experience that the team had
            (no one had any sort of previous experience in console games before,
            in fact!), to even the one time where a key team member ended up
            going to the hospital after a traffice accident, it all started
            piling up, but the team kept going, and now the team itself was
            feeling slightly uncertain about it, but they still kept going -
            the group decided to order a first run of about thirty thousand
            copies as they did not expect the game to sell well at all... until
            it did.</p>
            <p>Following the day of its release, December 6th of 1996, everyone
            was proven wrong.<br>
            PaRappa the Rapper proceeded to sell massively well despite the
            rather limited promotion Sony gave it, the low expectations of
            the creators and developers, and the fact that in Japan, it released
            on the same day as the already internationally succesful Crash
            Bandicoot. The 30,000 copies that Matsuura and his team had told
            Sony to make sold out quickly, and within a year it sold about
            750,000 copies there. By the end of the 5th generation of game
            consoles, almost 3 million copies were sold world wide, most of them
            in Japan.</p>
            <h2>International Releases</h2>
            <p>While many of those on the gaming press were interested on PaRappa
            after hearing about its success following its initial release in
            Japan, there was no intent to release PaRappa the Rapper outside of
            that country at first. It was only when it turned out that PaRappa was
            selling like hotcakes in Japan that Sony's international divisions
            got interested on the game.</p>
            <p>The European release came first, and in order to prepare for this,
            the game was translated to French, German, Italian and Spanish in
            addition to the existing English translation from the original
            Japanese release, with all of these translations being available on
            all versions of the PAL release. The game also ended up being
            moderately successful in the UK, with it reaching #6 in the
            all-formats charts after its release on September 26th of 1997.</p>
            <p>The American release only came about two months later, with it
            featuring both the full 60fps you'd get from a NTSC release
            alongside all the language options from the PAL one.<br>
            While Matsuura and Rodney had originally intended the game to be
            older teenagers and college-aged young adults in Japan, and the
            European advertisers seemingly marketed the game to general audiences
            regardless of age, the American ones aimed PaRappa towards
            children, despite Rodney, who was in contact with them's belief
            that it wouldn't go well with them because the game would be too
            difficult for young kids to finish.</p>
