    <!-- Summary. <<- what are these things for???????? no shit this is what you see when you load the page! - wakfu[CK] -->
        <p>In a very superficial level, the gameplay system in PaRappa 2
        remains unchanged from that of previous games: every song is
        divided by lines, and you repeat the teacher's lines as you go -
        shake things up by freestyling and you'll achieve Cool Mode.
        <br>In reality, however, the gameplay of previous entries has
        been expanded upon and refined in order to make both playing
        through the game and scoring easier.</p>
        <p>The most obvious new mechanic added in PaRappa 2 are the score
        meters - the Repeat-meter, the Freestyle-meter and the Funk-meter,
        which reward proper timing, skilled improvisation and shuffle
        rhythm respectively.</p>

        <p>After every other stage is cleared, there's a bonus game.<br>
        In this bonus game, you will control PaRappa in order to kick,
        punch, chop or block the items which the Kotamanagi hold.
        The amounts of points earned.</p>
        <p>In addition to all of this, the game has a "circuit system"
        in order to motivate you towards 100% completion and more in-game
        features. Each following circuit changes the color of PaRappa's hat
        to a different one (from blue to pink to yellow following the first
        playthrough), but also sets the difficulty of the songs to be
        higher.<br>
        After completing the fourth and final circuit, you will unlock
        a special music video, as well as the Record Store, which will
        let you listen to the tracks of each stage and the music video's,
        as well as a bonus song in-game.</p>
