            <h2>Did you know that...</h2>
            <ul><li>PaRappa was originally drawn as a variety of species, including
                a shrimp before being turned into a dog?</li>
                <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Concept%20Art/sketchSunyDad.jpeg"
                align="right" height="250px">
                <li>General Potter was going to be an important character in
                the story, with him possibly even going to have a stage in the
                game between Fleaswallow and Cheap Cheap's, as shown in a
                note in his concept design.</li>
                <li>A character called Pony Pony was created around the same time
                as PJ, Sunny and Katy, but never actually made it into the game?
                However, <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220726-185716.png">she makes a cameo
                as a poster in PaRappa's bedroom</a>, <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//1-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%20%281996%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%20%28USA%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29-220726-185910.png">
                as well as in Club Fun's walls.</a></li>
                <li>There are quite the amount of unused graphics on the game,
                namely <a href="https://tcrf.net/images/a/a3/Parappaunusedpj.png">
                a model for PJ Berri in his normal appearance</a>, a sprite of
                Joe Chin and front facing beaks for Cheap Cheap, which can be
                seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_SVUssKKhY">here.</a></li>
                <li>In addition, unused models, most notably for Katy but also
                for PJ can be seen in both beta and final versions of cutscenes
                on the game.</li>
                <li>One of the first showcases of PaRappa to the public was in
                1996's Tokyo Game Show, in which it was very well recieved by
                the attendats and ended up stealing that year's show.</li>
                <li>The earliest known TV appeareance of PaRappa was on 1996,
                on the television show "Oh!". You can watch this show
                <a href="https://vid.puffyan.us/watch?v=k2-fzAVsVng">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>In Japan, the game released on the exact same day as the
                first Crash Bandicoot game, December 6th of 1996.</li>
                <li>For the PSP remake of the game's release in North America,
                there were a variety of contests and promotions you could sign
                up to, namely Chop Chop Master Onion's Rap Showdown, in which
                you had to submit your cover of one of three songs from the first
                game and Cheap Cheap's Cook up a Character Contest, in which you
                had to draw an original character for the franchise and the
                winner would get a drawing of said character made by Rodney
                Greenblat himself.</li>
                <li>Despite being for the most part accurate, the English
                translation of PaRappa the Rapper has a few typos, such as with
                Jet Baby being referred incorrectly on the intro scene and
                PaRappa being spelled with two Rs at one point during stage 4's
                cutscenes.</li>
            </ul>
