    <!-- Summary. <<- what are these things for???????? no shit this is what you see when you load the page! - wakfu[CK] -->
    <p>Much like previous entries in the series, PaRappa 2's prologue begins
    in a cinema.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20%282001%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830193810.jpg"

        alt="PaRappa and co. at the cinema" align="right" width="200px">
    However, in a stark contrast to previous entries, where it was just a movie
    that everyone was watching; the monster comes to life and starts throwing
    noodles at everyone, causing everyone in the room to run away.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20%282001%29/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830193835.jpg"
        alt="PaRappa locks the door" align="right" height="150px">
    PaRappa manages to escape, but he still hears the monster's steps inching
    closer and closer to his location. And just as the monster is about to open
    the door, he wakes up.</p>

        alt="Parappa's room, full of noodles" align="center" width="400px">

    <p>We find out that PaRappa won a 100 years' worth of noodle products
    with his dad on a contest at a burger shop; starting from there, all PaRappa
    has eaten is noodles - which has led him to become tired of them by this
    time.</p>
    <p>Later on that day, PaRappa goes to Sunny's house in order to eat lunch
    alongside her and PJ. However, that day Sunny ends up only serving noodles
    - which leads PaRappa to a mental breakdown.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830193939.jpg"

    Sunny then calls him a baby for that, which worsens his mental state even
    further and leads to him and PJ leaving Sunny's house in order to eat
    somewhere else.</p>

    <h2>Beard Burgers: A PaRappa Town Tradition!</h2>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830194531.jpg" 
        alt="PaRappa and PJ walking around town" align="left" height="150px">
    <p>Following the incident at Sunny's house, PaRappa and PJ decide to go
    around town in order to get something to eat. They end up thinking about
    burgers, and go to Beard Burgers, PaRappa Town's most emblematic burger
    joint.</p>
    <p>In there, PaRappa and PJ order for some classic Beard Burgers - only to be
    served noodle burgers instead.<br>

        alt="PaRappa complains about noodles in his burgers" align="right" width="200px">
    This leads PaRappa to complain about getting
    the wrong order, but he is soon told that the burgers are getting turned
    into noodles and that he should just try the noodles instead, which leads
    to PaRappa getting even angrier.
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830194958.jpg"
        alt="If only our president were alive..." align="right" height="150px">
    However, shortly after that the dog overhars a pair of employees complaining
    about the new manager, wishing that the old president was with them instead
    as they can have "no baby running the store".<br>
    The word "baby" ends up making PaRappa remember what had happened with Sunny
    just before, as he imagines a scenario where she dumps him in favor of Joe
    Chin, not only calling him a baby, but surrounding him with them as well.</p>

        alt="Beard Burger Master arrives" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>At this point, however, Beard Burger Master, the original founder and
    president of Beard Burgers' ghost steps out of a poster and calls everyone
    out. Once that's done, he decides to teach PaRappa how to make actual
    burgers, leading to <strong>Stage 1 - Toasty Buns</strong> after uttering
    "I gotta believe!"</p>

        alt="Reporter Rodney" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>We cut to outside of Beard Burgers, where a man resembling Rodney
    Alan Greenblat is currently reporting about the "noodlization"
    phenomenon that is currently occurring over PaRappa Town.</p>
    <p>PaRappa and PJ, who were now trying out some ice cream, find out they
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830195607.jpg"
        alt="Noodle ice cream" align="left" height="150px">
    ended up turning into noodles. This becomes the last straw for PaRappa's
    patience, and he decides to go home alongside PJ in order to tell his dad
    about the problem.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830195621.jpg"
        alt="General Potter watching TV" align="left" width="200px">
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830195625.jpg" align="right" width="200px">
    <p>By this time. Rodney's report ends, and we find out that General Potter
    is currently at PaRappa's home, trying to find solutions to the noodle
    problem alongside Papa PaRappa himself.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830195641.jpg" align="left" width="200px"> 
    <p>It is at this point that Papa PaRappa finishes a new invention - tailor-
    made to solving the noodle problem. After Potter praises the new invention,
    PaRappa's dad gives him the remote control that will help him test it out.
    <br>It takes a few tries for Potter to actually be able to use Papa
    PaRappa's remote control - the light green button turns out to be useless,
    while the rounder dark green button activates the cat was instead. However,
    once General Potter pushes the green, but square button, the de-noodlizer
    finally activates...<br>
    ...and ends up shrinking both of them instead.</p>

    <p>At the same time, PaRappa and PJ finally arrive to their destination.<br>
    Since Papa PaRappa and Potter shrunk, the two friends assume no one is
    around, which renders all of Papa PaRappa and Potter's pleading for help
    moot.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830195823.jpg" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>PJ then introduces PaRappa to the TV show <em>Romantic Karate</em>, which
    would help the duo to lose weight quickly. PaRappa quickly accepts PJ's
    suggestion, and the two start watching the show.<br>
    However, the show is mentioned to be "strictly for adults" - which leads
    PaRappa to another imagination segment, as he sees himself with his friends,
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa The Rapper 2 (2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa the Rapper 2_SCUS-97167_20220830195951.jpg" align="left" height="150px">
    Sunny and Joe Chin all watching a show called "Danger Tick". When the tick
    dies, everyone finds it hilarious except for PaRappa. Sunny and Joe Chin
    then agree on it being "definitely not for kids" on the account of its
    supposed edginess, and after hearing this, PaRappa forces himself to laugh
    as to fit in with the others.</p>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830200017.jpg" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>Soon after, however, PaRappa manages to snap out of it with some cues
    from PJ; and he is surprised at seeing that the host of the show is none
    other than Chop Chop Master Onion - who tells the audience that even if
    they're too young, his new techniques will make them join the world of
    adults. This alleviates PaRappa's previous fears, starting <strong>Stage
    2 - Romantic Love</strong>.</p>

    <h2>HEY! Grab That Remote Control!</h2>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830200957.jpg" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>After Romantic Karate ends, PaRappa starts wondering where everyone else
    is. PJ tries to guess, but little do the two of them know that Papa PaRappa
    and General Potter are right between them, pleading to be brought back to
    normal.</p>
    <p>PJ then grabs the remote control to change channels, and ends up briging
    them back to normal. However, PaRappa doesn't want to watch such a channel,
    grabbing the remote control and shrinking both his dad and Potter again.
    This leads to a small fight between PJ and PaRappa for the remote control.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830201010.jpg" align="left" width="200px">

    PJ then starts wondering if they have ghosts in their house, but little
    do they know that PaRappa would end up accidentally pushing the remote's
    button and shrinking both his friend and himself as well.</p>

    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830201109.jpg" align="right" height="150px">
    <p>At this point, Papa PaRappa tells his son that he was calling him and
    PJ through all that time, but PaRappa reminds his dad that he didn't know
    what he meant by that.</p>

    <p>It is at this time, however, that more people enter PaRappa's house.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830201120.jpg" align="left" height="150px">
    First, it's the three ladies of MilkCan, who want to tell PaRappa about
    the current incident. Much like before, the ones shrunk start pleading them
    to grab the remote control. Katy ends up doing so, but gets both herself and
    Lammy shrunk instead. Ma-san, who was by now sitting on the couch ends up
    being spared from the supposed de-noodlizer's effects due to pure positioning
    and takes control of the remote from there on.<br>
    <img src="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com//3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20(2001)/Screenshots/PaRappa%20the%20Rapper%202_SCUS-97167_20220830201243.jpg" align="left" width="200px">

    <p>By that time, however, a bunch of random people start coming to PaRappa's
    house for whatever reason; including delivery workers, cleaning service,
    "visitors from space" and random passerby; all of which end up quickly being
    shrunk by Ma-san.</p>

    <p>The amount of people walking by starts making PaRappa more and more
    impatient towards the goal of returning back to his original size - but just
    at the right time, a mysterious ant comes from the window, seemingly replying
    to PaRappa's, and possibly everyone's calls.</p>

    <p>As Guru Ant falls into the scenery and starts talking to the crowd,
    PaRappa starts daydreaming again as he imagines how Sunny would treat him if
    he stayed tiny.</p>

    <p>Following his seemingly cynical words, however, Guru Ant hints at a way to
    return back to normal by "creating your own groove". This makes PaRappa
    feel good again, and starts <strong>Stage 3 - Big</strong>.</p>
    <p>At the end of the stage, however, Guru Ant notices that he is bigger than
    usual now.</p>

    building, they find out there's someone controlling everything behind

    after finding out that he preferred to eat burgers with PJ for the time,
    she started thinking about her previous actions and went back home, in which
    she would see PaRappa growing big alongside Guru Ant through one of the
    windows after watching Romantic Karate, and during the events of Stage 4,
    she watched PaRappa train alongside Moosesha wit her dad.<br>

    one of the soldiers gives the dog a letter written by Noodle himself, in
    which he invites him to play at a concert at a stage that he got them.
    <br>Shortly before the concert starts, he tells Sunny that despite all
    his attempts at becoming "more mature", he doesn't think he really became
    such a thing, so he will instead just be himself this time. Sunny then
    comforts him, telling PaRappa that he is man enough already, as he believes
    in himself and never gives up</p>

    Burgesr has gotten surprisingly fond of the new noodle dishes, Papa PaRappa
    is still coming up with crazy inventions and PaRappa is hanging out again
    at Sunny's house, now being able to eat whatever he wants again - except
    for cheese, because he won a lifetime supply of cheese.</p>
