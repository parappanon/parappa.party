                    through a popcorn making machine, which amazes Parappa, and

                    an opportunity to get his autograph.<br>

                    people which desperately want Schimidt to give them
                    autographs too, with Parappa being flattened as Schmidt
                    autographies the signs these fans gave him. Thankfully,
                    Sunny tells Parappa that not all hope is lost yet.</p>

                    baseball jerseys and ready to follow Schmidt - even if
                    the destination is the locker room. Gaster then proceeds
                    to drag a knocked out Groober by the feet, regardless of
                    whether Schmidt noticed or not.</p>

                    that Schmidt loves bananas - and they eventually find one

                    assistants and telling Parappa to wait until Schmidt returns
                    to get an autograph from him. However, once Schmidt returns
                    he refuses to give Parappa an autograph as he's more focused
                    on getting his banana back - which he then ends up
                    appearing suddenly, with the baseball player proceeding
                    to hug it - only for it to turn out to be the bait used by
                    Gaster and Groober in order to capture Schmidt; as Katy
                    notices. Once Schmidt is captured, he is sent into a cage
                    full of bananas, and Gaster even forces some of them into
                    his mouth in order to shut him up.</p>

                    one, but a trail full of them leading to a destination which
                    they're unsure of, but follow anyways as rescuing Schmidt
                    is the biggest priority. The boys then start following
                    the path while riding their bicycles, with Matt also
                    carrying the seemingly intact engines of the zeppelin
                    alongside him. This trail then leads them into a seemingly
                    abandoned warehourse, where Gaster and Groober plan to use
                    Schmidt for an autographed T-shirt business.</p>

                    Once the trio is in, they start punching Gaster and Groboer

                    free Schmidt. However, when PJ sees the sleeping Schmidt,
                    he starts wanting to go to sleep as well.</p>

                    three boys. Matt attempts to decieve Gaster by telling him
                    that he doesn't know anything about the Schmidt plan, but
                    Gaster quickly detects his claims as lies - which only
                    makes the situation even worse.<br>
                    And ultimately, the gang finds themselves in a showdown

                    rabbit to try dropkicking them - only for him to end up
                    hitting the roof and getting himself stuck instead. The
                    boys take this as a chance to get out and rescue Schmidt,
                    but Groober appears as soon as they turn the other way.
                    As the troublemaker duo encircles Parappa, Matt and PJ
                    even more tightly, the three boys decide to jump together
                    instead in order to crash everyone down into the building
                    - which leads the warehouse to break down as the characters
                    fall into the floor.<br>
                    However, this also frees Schmidt.</p>

                    <p>After finding out Schmidt is free now, Parappa asks him
                    for an autograph. However, Schmidt is about to be late for
                    his game, which leads Matt to make an impromptu jetpack for
                    him with the engines he got from the time Gaster and
                    Groober's zeppelin self-destructed. However, the lack of
                    an autograph dissappoints Parappa a bit.</p>

                    <p>Hours later, a depressed Parappa goes back to the
                    baseball field, but he doesn't feel happy as he still
                    wants Schmidt's autograph.<br>
                    However, hours later, Schmidt enters the field, and Parappa
                    immediately notices, but doesn't put his hopes up on getting
                    an autograph, which leads to Matt telling Sunny, who then
                    tells Katy, who then tells Schmidt about Parappa really
                    wanting to get something as a gratitude for rescuing Schmidt.

                    This leads Schmidt to decdicate his next ball to no one
                    other than Parappa himself, which surpises even him as
                    Schmidt hits a home run, and Parappa succesfully catches
                    the ball even as the rest of the crowd desperately wants
                    it.</p>

                    <p>The episode ends with an elated Parappa giving Schmidt
                    thanks for the ball, which he cherishes.</p>
