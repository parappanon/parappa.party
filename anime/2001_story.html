                    with his hat feeling particularly heavy. It soon turns out
                    that this is because his hat is now a nest for the bird
                    he helped's children, and now he has to deal with not
                    only taking care of the little birds but also the increasing
                    popularity of themed beanies similar to his across PaRappa
