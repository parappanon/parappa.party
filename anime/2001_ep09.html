                         height="150" align="left">
                    <p>The episode starts with a sequence where, in front of
                    the whole audience at the hall PaRappa and Sunny win a
                    Best Couple award at a dance party. After they look at
                    each other, Sunny holds PaRappa's hand and the two of them
                    start dancing together again as everyone looks at them.<br>
                    However, it all soon turns out that it was just PaRappa's
                    dream.</p>

                    <p>At school, meanwhile, everyone seems to be talking about
                    a dance party what is going to be held soon. Katy asks PJ
                    if he can go with her, but PJ rejects her; which leads
                    Katy to ask Matt out instead, who accepts. As Parappa
                    overhears these conversations, he starts remembering his
                    dream from last and wanting to invite Sunny out, who was
                    about to enter the classroom alongside Paula.<br>
                    Katy asks Paula for who she's going to go with for the dance
                    party, but the vixen soon tells her that she didn't like
                    any of the prospects who asked her out. In order to not
                    let the others down, however, Paula confirms them that she
                    is indeed going to the party as she's been hired as one of
                    the staff members - which shocks everyone, as they remind
                    Paula that for her job. she'll have to dress up in a bunny
                    suit - while technically a full body one, Paula still
                    refuses the idea of wearing it for a few seconds.</p>

                    <p>Following that, Katy asks Sunny if she's going to go out
                    with someone, shocking Parappa. Sunny tells Paula that
                    she's going to wear a red dress to the party, which Parappa
                    takes out of context as he immediately worries and assumes
                    it means that Sunny is already going to go out with someone
                    else, despite Matt and Sunny's attempts to convince him that
                    this is not the case Parappa starts imagining Sunny dumping
                    him for someone else, which starts worrying his friends.</p>

                    <p>However, little do they know that a little pink bear is
                    not only interested in, but following them.</p>

                         width="200" align="left">
                    <p>After school, Matt tries to encourage Parappa to go ask
                    Sunny out, but due to Parappa's reclutance he decides to
                    just drag him out instead, with PJ following them.<br>
                    As the boys start following Sunny, Parappa notices that
                    Sweety Bancha is apparently following them, but Sweety,
                    after realizing she has been found out tries to divert his
                    attention.<br>
                    Meanwhile, as the boys battle against traffic in order to
                    get Parappa closer to Sunny, Matt notices that Sunny has
                    entered the Parappa Town Department Store, and encourages
                    Parappa to go with him. PJ notices there's an ice cream
                    truck nearby and decides to check it out as well, much to
                    Matt's chagrin.</p>

                         width="200" align="right">
                    <p>The boys then take an elevator to the 4th floor, which
                    is the store's women's section in order to get closer to
                    her, and soon she approaches them after finding out that
                    they were at the store. A flustered Parappa tries to
                    ask her out for the dance party - but is interrupted by
                    a saleswoman, who drags Sunny to try out some makeup after
                    seeing how cute she is.</p>

                    <p>Parappa, Matt and PJ wait for her downstairs, but just
                    as she arrives the alarm announces a sale at the underground
                    market, which reminds Sunny to go there so she could buy
                    some stuff for her mother at the bakery.<br>
                    After they meet up with Sunny again at the bakery, though,
                    both Parappa and Sunny blush at the fact that they tried to
                    ask each other out at the same time, leading to an awkward
                    slience which Matt soon breaks in order to encourage
                    Parappa to ask Sunny out - but his shyness leads him to
                    instead ask Sunny to buy her bread.<br>

                         width="200" align="right">
                    Just as Sunny is about to leave, however, Parappa finally
                    decides to stand up in his own two feet and ask her out
                    for the dance party - just to be glomped by Sweety
                    immediately, with her asking him out instead even if
                    Parappa does now want to. At the same time, Sunny and PJ
                    start getting seemingly interested on each other, which
                    shocks Parappa. This leads to Sunny and PJ going to the
                    dance party together.</p>

                    <p>Once it's time for the dance party, both couples
                    show up at the restaurant where the party is going to be
                    held. Katy notices the switcharoo, but Matt tells her not
                    to worry. Meanwhile, Parappa still keeps thinking about
                    Sunny even if she's technically with PJ this time.<br>
                    However, Gaster and Groober are also planning to
                    scheme something, and while rejected at first, Groober
                    proceeds to diguise himself as a woman, which lets them in.
                    </p>

                    <p>Parappa, meanwhile was feeling worried about not being
                    next to Sunny and having to deal with Sweety instead, which
                    leads her to drag him against his will so she can play with
                    him until he gets exhausted instead.<br>
                    At the same time, Katy points at Sunny's brooch, which
                    she tells the gang was a gift from her mother by her father,
                    which they got after winning the Best Couple award in a
                    dance party from back in the day and has been precious to
                    her mother since then.</p>

                    <p>Soon enough, though, Gaster and Groober start their
                    real plan, which consists of stealing as many of the
                    attendants' jewelry as possible, inluding the increasingly
                    bored of the party Sunny Funny's precious brooch, who
                    ultimately decides on returning home after realizing that
                    PJ had been asleep for the entirety of the party until
                    now - which wakes up PJ, who similarly decides to just go
                    back home.</p>

                    <p>It is at this point, however, that the Best Couple
                    contest starts. Gaster and Groober, who had all intentions
                    of leaving, end up staying just before they're announced
                    as the Best Couple of the party; while Sunny and PJ decide to
                    leave anyway - which ends up worrying Parappa and Sweety
                    Bancha, to everyone's shock.<br>
                    This leads Sweety to reveal that she actually loved PJ, and
                    that she only tried to get close to Parappa because she
                    though it'd make PJ pay attention to her, apologizing for
                    her actions as she bursts into crocodile tears. Sunny,
                    however, consoles her as much as she can.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, as Gaster and Groober show off their dance

                    by one, with all the remaining items falling at once
                    just as Sunny finally notices that her brooch disappeared
                    - and this enrages the other guests so much they start
                    chasing the duo out.
                    <br>
                    The brooch would soon be picked up by Parappa, who noticed
                    it now was right next to him, and the dog soon gives her
                    the brooch, seeing that it was of emotional importance to
                    her. Sunny gives him thanks, and just at the moment he
                    asks her to dance with him, the fireworks start.</p>

                    <p>The episode ends with Parappa and friends watching the
                    fireworks show, but Parappa notices that Sweety is now
                    clinging to PJ even if he doesn't seem too fond of such
                    touchy-feely displays of affection.</p>
