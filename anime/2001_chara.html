                    <p><strong>PaRappa:</strong> Much like in the games, the
                    titular rapping pup is the anime's protagonist. Much like
                    in the games, he hangs out with his friends and has a
                    crush on Sunny Funny. However, he doesn't really rap
                    much, despite getting involved in all sorts of crazy
                    situations. He is also a lot more anxious than his game
                    counterpart, being prone to tears and also rather clumsy.</p>

                    <p><strong>PJ Berri: </strong>PaRappa's best friend, a lazy
                    bear that eats and sleeps during the day and DJs at Club
                    Fun by night. He tends to be rather standoffish, but also
                    cares a lot about his friends when something happens to
                    them.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p><strong>Sunny Funny: </strong>A friendly and kind flower
                    girl, who Parappa is hopelessly in love with. She tends to
                    worry a lot about others, and when someone needs her, she's
                    always around to help them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Katy Kat: </strong>An outgoing and fashionable
                    feline. She's very confident in herself and headstrong in
                    her opinions, but that doesn't mean she doesn't have any
                    doubts or insecurities about herself. In the anime, she's
                    shown to be a bit more strict than in the games, where
                    she's usually very positive.</p>

                    for his intelligence and resourcefulness. He tends to act
                    like an older brother towards PaRappa, but can also be
                    very ridiculous at times. Despite being popular with the
                    girls at school, he doesn't seem to be that interested in
                    dating anyone.</p>

                    leader and a social butterfly who likes partying and sports.
                    <br>
                    She can be mean and impulsive at times, but she's also

                    younger sister, who always goes out alongside her pet Uee.<br>
                    While usually reserved, she is also remarkably curious

                    and cunning personality whose goal in life is to scare the
                    residents of Parappa Town. However, he is also bad at
                    accepting defeat, and his plans often get stopped by
                    Parappa and his friends.</p>

                    slightly apathetic about most things, but willing to
                    listen to Gaster's ambitious schemes.</p>
