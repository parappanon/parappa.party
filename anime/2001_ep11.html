                    <p>That was Considerably Heavy is the 11th episode of the
                    Parappa the Rapper anime, written by Hiroshi Hashimoto and
                    directed by Ken Andou. Much like episode 5, this episode's
                    storyboarder was Hiroyuki Imaishi, best known for
                    spearheading Studio Trigger.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    The episode starts at the skatepark. As PaRappa and PJ
                    challenge each other to a skateboarding match match, Matt
                    is busy reading a book about called "Dictionary of Great
                    Men". However, as Matt tries to tell Parappa and PJ about
                    this, the three guys crash into each other.</p>

                         alt="Matt telling Parappa and PJ about Mr. Ieday"
                         height="150" align="left">
                    Following this, Matt dramatically tells Parappa and PJ
                    about the book he's reading and how great of a person he
                    is, but Parappa just asks him who is the person the statue
                    is meant to represent. The other dog then tells him it's a
                    statue of Mr. Ieday, a figure notable enough to have a
                    bronze statue of him erected in that very same skatepark.
                    </p>

                    <p>After getting his friends interested, Matt explains to
                    PaRappa and PJ that in order to become great men, they'll
                    have to run away from home with him and not tell anyone else
                    about it, much like Mr. Ieday. The two of them agree with
                    Matt, and after picking their things up, they reunite
                    again at the skatepark.<br>

                    When Matt asks PaRappa and PJ if they kept their promises,
                    however, PaRappa reveals that he actually told Sunny about
                    it, and that she's interested.<br>
                    It also turns out that Katy and Paula found out about it
                    too, and despite being skeptical at first, Matt convinces
                    them to support their journey - which leads to a farewell
                    party being hosted by Katy in the middle of Parappa Town,
                    much to Parappa's chagrin. However, he starts feeling
                    better as he sees the girls, and specially Sunny cheering
                    for him.</p>

                    having fun. Little do they know, however, that Gaster and
                    Groober are not only riding the same bus, but also scheming
                    a plan to become similarly recognized as well.<br>
                    While most of the people in the bus are singing Love

                    only keep getting worse as a train actually comes and
                    completely destroys the bus, causing all the passengers,
                    including Parappa, PJ and Matt to fall down, with them

                    chicken so quickly one of the legs he had falls off his
                    hand and ends up next to Parappa, who suspects it was
                    given by his relatives.<br>
                    However, this does not prevent the boys from falling down
                    into a waterfall, with them barely saving themselves
                    through a falling branch which leads them into a cave.

                    After arriving in this cave, the guys find a treasure

                    and Groober end up in the same cage, mad at the fact that
                    they ended up there. Parappa tells them to go away, but
                    knowing that these two are not the types of people to leave
                    quickly, Matt decides to throw the treasure chest on Gaster,
                    causing them to fall down and allowing Parappa and friends

                    <p>Once they see a highway, Parappa and friends are very
                    exhausted, but Matt and PJ remind the dog to keep his hopes
                    up - and it is at this moment that they see a heavy-load
                    truck driving through, and whose driver is kind enough
                    to drive them to their destination, even if things don't
                    seem like they'll go as planned.</p>

                    and end up in the scorching heat of a desert. They
                    are hungry and tired, but Matt thankfully finds some fruits
                    - which turn out to be impossible to eat. Despite that,
                    Matt reminds them that on the way to this desrt, they
                    faced many other threats - first an elephant man crashing
                    his horns into the truck and then a tornado, and after that
                    almost falling off a cliff. Parappa then adds a volcano, a

                    boys then proceed to order as many burgers to eat as they
                    possibly could. However, the temporary bliss doesn't last
                    long as the waiter forces them to wash all of the plates
                    after it turns out that they didn't have any money with
                    them. The boys don't care much about having to clean things,
                    however, and they decide to make things faster by breaking
                    the plates instead. The employee at the burger joint,
                    immediately kicks them out of the establishment after he
                    finds out, however, causing dissappointment.<br> 
                    This leads Parappa and PJ to consider going back home, which
                    they tell to Matt. However, Matt refuses to give up on his
                    goal of becoming a great man, and decides to keep moving
                    on.</p>

                    the desert, and he now feels like his bodt is about to give

                    <p>Ultimately, the tired Matt finally finds an Ieday statue,
                    and he realizes that this is the real one. Following that,
                    he starts reading the inscription in its base: "IEDAY
                    Bridge. This was build by IEDAY who worked hard for years
                    without sleep to complete the bridge. However, after
                    completion, he had suffered from an illness and passed
                    away. In gratitude of IEDAY, we name this IEDAY Bridge -
                    IEDAY."<br>
                    Matt turns around, however, and sees Ieday next to him - 
                    except it's not really Mr. Ieday, but Gaster and Groober
                    pretending to be him.</p>

                    at this moment, Parappa makes an appearance, skateboarding
                    his way to Matt and feeding all of the stew he got from the
                    kind old lady at the forest with him. This food not only
                    fills Matt's stomach, but also convices the policeman that
                    Gaster and Groober are the real culprits after looking at
                    Matt's now healthier face, which means that the troublemaker
                    duo is now being arrested - and as a show of gratitude,
                    the police officer gives the boys bus tickets back home.</p>

                    After they leave, the boys decide to go back to their homes.

                    this case to the beach. Before leaving for home, Pinto gives

                    his idea critically, telling him to forget about it.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The name of Ieday comes from the Japanese word for
                            "Runaway".

                        <li>
                            Early on the episode, there's a unusually well
                            animated train crash scene. This scene is most
                            likely stock footage, however.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The train appearing in the train crash scene is
                            most likely an Amtrak Sunset Limited train, which
                            is a passenger train line which covers the southern
                            US from Los Angeles to New Orleans. During the
                            time the Parappa anime was airing, its route went
                            all the way to Orlando.
