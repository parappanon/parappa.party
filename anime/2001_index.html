                <p>In the year 2001, in order to promote the PaRappa the Rapper
                franchise, Sony announced an anime series.<br>
                This anime was directed by Hiroaki Sakurai, animated by JC
                Staff and Production I.G and produced by SME Visual Works in
                conjunction with Fuji TV, who would then broadcast the show as
                well as all future Parappa programs on TV.</p>

                <p>This anime adaptation, despite sharing the original setting
                and characters is very different in tone from that of the
                games, forgoing the raps and surrealistic premises in favor of
                more typical slice of life dynamics and moral lessons at the
                end of some of the episodes. It also contains original
                characters designed by Rodney specifically for it, as well as
                a new soundtrack and theme songs.</p>

                <p>However, the anime ended up not being as successful as
                originally planned due to a mix of low reception from the
                intended audience, strife between the original creators and
                Sony due to their limits on their involvement on the Parappa
                anime and other possible production issues. This led to the anime
                only lasting 30 episodes, and no further mainline releases in
                the Parappa franchise.</p>

                <p>Despite that, the Parappa anime has managed to avoid being
                lost to time thanks to the efforts of fans, who have managed to
                recover each and every one of the episodes, as well as translate
                them to other languages!</p>
