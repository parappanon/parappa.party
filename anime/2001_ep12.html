                    <p>Is it Scary? is the 12th episode of the

                    directed by Yoshihisa Matsumoto.<br>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Plot</h2>
                    <p>The episode starts late at night in Parappa Town.<br>
                    We see Sunny Funny walking across the street, but noticing
                    that something's going on. She then turns around; and shocked
                    at what she just saw, she lets out a loud scream.</p>

                    align="left">
                    <p>The episode then cuts to a scene where Parappa falls
                    off his skateboard just after the boys hear her. As they
                    wonder what could have been the reason behind such a screen,
                    a car passes through the street, and as Matt sees who's
                    driving, he suspects it might be a monster who scared her
                    off. The dog tells Parappa and PJ that there's been a lot
                    of rumors surrounding sigthings of monsters all over
                    PaRappa Town, scaring Parappa and making him tell Matt that
                    he should stop. However, Matt reminds Parappa that it's
                    just a rumor. The episode then goes back to Sunny, who
                    realizes that the monster statue at the cinema she just
                    looked at was just a statue.</p>

                    <p>At the same time, Katy is reading a book about ghosts at
                    Paula's house when she starts hearing weird sounds seemingly
                    coming from the window. Paula, who had just brought some
                    stuff for them to get is told about this by Katy, and the
                    vixen then reminds her that everything currently being
                    told about the monsters are just rumors, opening the window
                    in order to prove Katy wrong. Katy then decides to go to
                    the bathroom, which leads Paula to snarkily tell her to
                    stay safe because there are monsters out there. Despite
                    the suspicions she's getting, Katy decides it's safe enough
                    for her to go down the bathroom.</p>

                    <p>Parappa starts walking home, and soon enough starts
                    getting scared by the things he sees around him; however,
                    he soon calms down and remembers that the statue
                    that scared him was just an object - just to sense that
                    something might be going on.<br>
                    As Katy goes down the bathroom, meanwhile; she starts
                    wondering if there's a ghost around the house. She ends up
                    feeling something, but doesn't think it was anything
                    notable.<br>
                    And Parappa doesn't thing anything seems out of the normal
                    anymore.</p>

                    discussing on how likely the rumors about monsters are to
                    be true, Sunny comes into the classroom; but just as Parappa
                    is about to tell her his opinons, Katy and Paula try
                    to silence him, believing that it might attract them.</p>

                    lack of people. The flower soon sits on a bench, but little
                    does she know that the she is going to be kidnapped - once

                    the others where they think Sunny's located, Katy and Paula
                    point to an ominous-looking castle on a hill, which will

                    cannot go back anymore, and as he remembers that Sunny is
                    somewhere inside the manor he cries for a bit, but soon
                    arms up enough courage to tell the others to go together -
                    only to find out that he is being left behind.<br>

                    notices that a piece of meat in the kitchen is suddenly
                    cute in half, or when the windows start flapping quickly,

                    <p>This leads PaRappa and friends to sit down for a meal,
                    who are now asking for the reason behind why Sunny is in
                    the haunted house.<br>
                    The leader of the ghosts and monsters, who's a ghost
                    that resembles Count Dracula then tells the gang that
                    despite their constant attempts to scare people, they were
                    always unfazed by the incidents they caused.
                    This leads to a flashback showing that there were
                    entities really behind all the incidents they thought were
                    creepy or weird, but that they didn't think it was their
                    doing at all. Sunny, however, was always scared by the
                    monsters' actions, and that was the reason why they
                    brought her into the party</p>

                    <p>After hearing the full story, the gang answers in
                    various ways, but ultimately PaRappa decides to stand in
                    front of them, only for Katy to come up with the idea of
                    of giving  them a makeover - as Paula soon starts applying
                    makeup on them and Matt directs a synchronized dance to 
                    them.</p>

                    <p>To finish the episode, PaRappa and Sunny take a photo
                    alongside some of the monsters they met at the party - the
                    gang says cheese, PJ takes the photo and the resultws come
                    out.<br>
                    However, the final photograph scares Katy, Matt, Paula and
                    PJ out of the house, surprising PaRappa, Sunny and the
                    monsters.</p>

                    <h2>Trivia</h2>

                        <li>
                            There was a 27 day break between the airing of
                            Episode 11 and this episode. The reasons
                            behind this extremely long break are unknown,
                            but it is likely to have been a result of
                            production issues and schedule shifting in favor of
                            baseball games at the time.
