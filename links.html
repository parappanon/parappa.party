                    Greenblat's personal website, which contains a lot of
                    information about not only PaRappa, but his other works
                    across his life and various fields.</li>

                    </a>: The #1 place for PaRappa news and official content,
                    straight out of Japan! It's been around for over 20 years
                    now, and it even has a mailing list for anyone who wants to
                    keep up with the latest PaRappa news (although in Japanese

                    Music PaRappa Site"></a>: A nifty PaRappa page made to
                    promote the anime that has, somehow, managed to survive
                    to this day. It, however, quite literally cannot function
                    without the now-outdated Flash, so you might want to grab
                    <a href="https://ruffle.rs">Ruffle</a> if you want to see

                    sites that were out there around 2001-2002. Unlike the Sony
                    Music site, however, parappa-the-rapper.com has not managed
                    to survive to this day, and its archive isn't exactly
                    complete. Still a really good browse, though.</li>
