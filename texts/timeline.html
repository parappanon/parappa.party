                <h1>The PaRappa Timeline</h1>
                
                <p>I think all people who have gone through the main PaRappa games
                    can agree that the PaRappa timeline goes like this:</p>
                <h4>PaRappa 1 -> Um Jammer -> PaRappa 2</h4>
                
                <p>But something that not as many people know or can agree on is whether the
                    non-game media fit in that timeline or not - most notably the 2001
                    anime. Nor how much time passes between games.
                </p>
                
                <p>Because yes, did you know that a year actually passes in-universe between
                    the first PaRappa game and Um Jammer Lammy's events? 
                </p>
                
                <p>But before I go on details about the PaRappa timeline and how it all fits,
                    let's first try to ground the series to something resembling a time period
                </p>
                
                <h2>Time Period</h2>
                <p>The time period in where the PaRappa games happen seems to be around... the
                    presenr day.</p>
                
                <p>Yes, I know it's obvious, and some more detail-obsessed people might ask me
                    "why just 'the present day'" when the tech is so obviously coded to be
                    akin to the late 1990s-early 2000s, <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com/%21-RodneyFun/RodneyFun%20Comic%20Collection/RFCC-04-11.jpg">as seen in PaRappa's room on PaRappa Gets a Job?"</a><br>
                    And my answer to that might as well be "because the late 90s to very early 2000s was
                    when the PaRappa franchise was in full steam, it was the present day back then"
                    since the PJ Berri no Mogumogu Munyamunya shorts show PaRappa using a smartphone, a
                    not-Instagram existing, and characters watching things from flatscreen TVs, yet not
                    having aged a single bit; nor any explicit time having been mentioned to pass in
                    reference to the games or other entries in the series (that I know of).
                </p>
                
                <p>There's also the 2001 PaRappa anime being considered as a prequel where PaRappa and
                    friends are younger by many, yet having an entire segment be a flashback to
                    PaRappa and Matt learning how to make a website on the computer.<br>
                    Computing and especially the Internet weren't seen until UJL, and even then the
                    Joe Chin laptop was nothing more than an overpriced gadget that was meant to look cool
                    more than anything else.<br>
                    It wouldn't be until PaRappa 2 that technology would play an important part in the
                    world's story and lore, with the backstory of the Noodle Syndicate actually involving
                    an in-universe equivalent of 2ch behind the scenes!<a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com/3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20%282001%29/Scans/Parappa%20the%20Rapper%202%20Guidebook/Page%20106%2B107.JPG">[1]</a>
                </p>

                <p>And with Gabin Itou mentioning that this detail was meant to make Colonel Noodle a 'modern'
                    character at the time <a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com/3-PaRappa%20The%20Rapper%202%20%282001%29/Scans/Parappa%20the%20Rapper%202%20Guidebook/Page%20114%2B115.jpg">[2]</a>,
                    it is likely that the PaRappa games weren't meant to be set in a concrete year, but rather
                    for the setting to be timeless despite it's apparent 90s radicality.
                </p>
                
                <p>Now that we have a "defined" time period (read: not at all), we can actually construct our
                    PaRappa Timeline.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Ordering the PaRappa Franchise</h2>
                
                <h3>PaRappa the Rapper (1996)</h3>
                <p>It's the first game... and the first entry to happen in our timeline.</p>
                
                <p>Arguably the least surprising part, I know.</p>
            
                <p>But something that you might not know is that <em>exactly a year</em> passes between it
                and or next entry, which is...</p>
                
                <h3>Um Jammer Lammy</h3>
                
                <p>Should have also been the obvious continuation too, especially since it's working name
                  was actually <em>PaRappa 2</em> (with the game we actually call PaRappa 2 being P3, the P
                  standing for PaRappa).
                </p>
                
                <p>As I mentioned previously this game happens a year after the first, and then you might
                    ask "how do you know it was a year after the first, and you're not bullshitting me up?".
                </p>
                
                <p>Well, it's pretty simple - it's on the lyrics to <em>The New Plan</em><a href="https://parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com/2-Um%20Jammer%20Lammy%20%281999%29/Scans/Albums/PaRappa%20and%20PJ%20-%20I%20Scream%21/SCN_0061.jpg">[3]</a>.<br>
                <blockquote>
                    Here comes Chief Puddle, squirting over there, Joe Chin, he's fronting over there<br>
                    About a year ago, he tried to take Sunny Funny just like how school bullies used to try to take
                    my money.
                </blockquote>
                </p>
                
                <p>Following this, he narrates the events of the first stage of PaRappa 1, confirming that PTR1
                    indeed happens a year prior to UJL's events.<br>
                    <blockquote>
                        But Master Chop Chop Onion made sure that the man is stopped - taught me the kick,
                        chop, punch and block!
                    </blockquote>
                </p>
                
                <p>Speaking of Chop Chop Master Onion, this game is the turning point in his series-long
                    character arc. He loses his dojo, his students, and the fact that he even lost his
                    dojo breaks one part of the franchise out of continuity to the rest of it, but bridges
                    another firmly with the rest by showing the beginning of something that would become a
                    lot more important later on...
                </p>
                
                <h3>Um Jammer Lammy NOW!</h3>
                
                <p>Um Jammer Lammy NOW! seems like a game that is meant to be just "UJL but fancier" on the
                    surface.</p>
                
                <p>
                    But if you have done so much as to watch the MilkCan interviews, you will come to the
                    realization that it's actually a sequel, happening shortly after the events of the original
                    game.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Very shortly, because the laptop ad happens right after you finish PaRappa's story mode
                    in the original console version of UJL, with it leading to a post-credits scene where
                    Ma-san tries actually using it.<br>
                    ...and this ad appears again in UJL NOW, alongside many other parody ads made exclusively
                    for UJL NOW!.
                </p>
                
                <p>One of these ads features Chop Chop Master Onion leading a fitness program, with his assistant
                    in it heavily resembling (or perhaps even being?) the same assistant he'd be seen with in
                    PaRappa 2.
                </p>
                
                <p>However, we can't get there just yet, because we have one non-game entry to cover...</p>
                
                <h3>RodneyFun Comic Collection</h3>
                
                <p>Or at least the first four comics, since Square E. Bear isn't really connected to the
                    PaRappa cast.
                </p>
                
                <p>But yes, they are canon. Even if they're written by Rodney as opposed to Gabin Itou
                    (with likely contributions from Matsuura, Rodney and RYU), they're still canon.
                    Rodney co-owns the PaRappa IP alongside Sony after all.
                </p>
                
                <p>We can confirm these comics happen between UJL (NOW) and PTR2 through this page of
                    Katy's Shopping Explosion, in which we see Lammy sitting next to Katy.</p>
                
                <img src="../images/article/timeline/rodneyfun-katy-clubfun.png" align="center" width="max-width">

                <p>Ma-san also appears in this picture.</p>
                
                <p>There are also various recurring locations across the comics such as Dot's Diner and
                   Buttonose's Shop, which further implies that these stories are one after the other
                   in the timeline.
                </p>
                
                <p>However, there are two things that haven't happened yet - PaRappa and Sunny finally
                    going steady and for real this time, as well as PJ and Sweety meeting and falling in
                    love.<br>
                    The first one of which wouldn't happen until the end of...
                </p>
                
                <h3>PaRappa the Rapper 2</h3>
                
                <p>Yep! Did you not expect it, like, at all?</p>
                
                <p>Well, it should have been obvious, but I think PaRappa 2 is more than just the last
                    of the main entries - it also permanently advances the timeline by finally declaring
                    PaRappa and Sunny's relationship as canon through the Come a Long Way music video,
                    with all major entries in the series after it (read: just one) following this.
                </p>

                <p>This also concludes PaRappa's character arc, which leads to the final entry in this
                    timeline to focus on another character...
                </p>
                
                <h3>PJ Berri no Mogumogu Munyamunya (PJ Berri's Munching Mumbling)
                </h3>
                
                <p>And we finally did it.<br>
                This is the last canon entry on the PaRappa series, and it sure is wonderful to know
                that it indeed is a sequel to the main games!</p>
                
                <p>PaRappa and Sunny are shown to be dating in this show, and we finally see PJ and
                    Sweety together - something that we know doesn't happen until <em>after</em> PTR2
                    due to Sweety only making cameo appearances at best until this show.
                </p>
                
                <p>The originally anime-exclusive characters Matt, Paula and Pinto also appear in this
                    series (although the latter does so only in a flashback), however, leading to one
                    last question.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Is the 2001 PaRappa 1 Anime Canon?</h2>
                
                <p>The short answer to this question is <strong>no</strong>.</p>
                
                <p>The longer answer to this question is a bit more complex, but also results in a "no".</p>
                
                <p>And you just need one episode to debunk any canoncity concerning the PaRappa anime -
                    Episode 13 to be exact.
                </p>
                
                <p>In this episode, Chop Chop Master Onion is mentioned to return to Parappa Town after
                    a year traveling the world, with him having taught PaRappa karate just before that
                    started - a yuear being also the gap between PTR1 and UJL<br>
                    However, CCMO managed to keep his dojo, which contradicts the games' continuity. 
                </p>
                
                <p>In addition, there's a theory that the 2001 PaRappa anime is a prequel, if related to
                    the rest of the series. However, this episode also debunks it due to the aforementioned
                    reasons, as well as it likely comning from a misinterpretation of <a href-"https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=88ec59efcc0d3ef7JmltdHM9MTcxMDQ2MDgwMCZpZ3VpZD0yZTI0ZGFlZC1mMTY1LTZiYzgtM2Q5Mi1jZWNkZjBkNTZhOTkmaW5zaWQ9NTE5NA&ptn=3&ver=2&hsh=3&fclid=2e24daed-f165-6bc8-3d92-cecdf0d56a99&psq=rodney+greenblat+interview">the GamaSutra interview with Rodney Greenblat.</a>
                </p>
                
                <p>Matt and Paula's appearances in MoguMunya don't seem to have them mentioning anything
                    related to the anime eihter, further implying that even if they have been canonized,
                    the anime was still not canon.
                </p>
                
                <p>Therefore, we can say that the 2001 PaRappa anime is a different continuity, which
                    might or might not have branched from PTR1.
                </p>
