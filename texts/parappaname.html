            <h1>On the Origin of PaRappa's Name</h1>
            <p>It’s “"popular knowledge" that the PaRappa name originates
            from "paper thin" in Japanese.<br>
            This bit of trivia is presented as fact in many Parappa-related
            pages across the internet, including Wikipedia and the PaRappa
            Fando(o)m wiki.</p>

            <p>But what if I told you that this "fact" is not just false,
            but downright baseless? And that Masaya Matsuura himself has
            explained from where the name “"PaRappa" actually came from?
            </p>

            <h2>Where Did the Misinformation Come From?</h2>
            <p>
            In the Wikipedia page for PaRappa (the character), it’s
            mentioned that the name PaRappa originated as a word play on
            "paper thin" in Japanese. This origin is referenced to have
            been sourced from a New York Times article from 1998 called
            "The Japanese Embrace Hip-Hop, and Parappa Is Born”.
            </p>

            <p>
            This article, written by the American J.C Herz, says the
            following about the origin of PaRappa’s name:
            </p>

            <h4>
            "Parappa, in fact, means "flat" or "paper thin" in Japanese.”
            </h4>

            <p>However, a quick search through Jisho for "Parappa” will
            only bring up PaRappa The Rapper, as shown in this screenshot:

            <p>
            Other dictionaries, such as Goo, don't give any results.
            </p>

            <img src="../images/article/parappaname/goo.png">

            <p>Meanwhile, the actual word used to describe "flat” in
            Japanese is taira 『平』.</p>L:w

            <p>And so, if PaRappa’s name doesn’t come from "paper thin”
            in Japanese, then where did it come from?</p>

            <p>Well, it turns out that Masaya Matsuura, original creator
            and director of the PaRappa games has actually explained
            where he got the PaRappa name from.
            </p>

            <h2>The Actual Origin of The Name PaRappa</h2>

            <p>For the European release of the first PaRappa the Rapper
            game, Masaya Matsuura was interviewed by the Official UK
            Playstation Magazine. This interview would then be published
            on Issue 23 in 1997. When asked about the origin of the name
            PaRappa, he answered with the following:

            <p>In order to confirm this, we'll visit <a href="http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/index/ha/8">The Jaded Network's Sound Effects Database</a>
            in order to find if they have any sound effects that sound
            similar enough to PaRappa. We go on the index, click on 「ハ」</p>
