# Authors, Acknowledgement and Credits
I'm giving credits to the following, for all their contributions and
influence to the project:
 
 * To Sony, Masaya Matsuura, Rodney Alan Greenblat, Gabin Itou and everyone
 else who worked on the series at NanaOnSha, J.C Staff, Production I.G, Doga
 Kobo, Fuji TV, among others for having brought this series to life and
 worked in it so much. Without you all, this site would not even be
 concievable.
 * To Wakfu[CK], for helping with the creation and work on many parts of
 the site during its early days. 
* To prximity, for contributing to the codebase by cleaning out the HTML
and CSS code for the index page.
* To Timkho, for helping me with the extraction of the thumbnails used on the
DVD part of the PaRappa anime's section of the site.
 * To the PaRappa The Rapper community online, for having encouraged me and
 fellow contributors to keep working on the site, no matter what, regardless
of platform.
 * And to you, for your interest on this project. I don't think you'd be
 here, looking at the source code if not for such a thing.
