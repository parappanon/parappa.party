            <h1>Welcome to Parappa.party Chat</h1>
            <p>Parappa Chat is a publicly accessible chatroom and homeserver.
            It currently uses the Matrix protocol, which is akin to Discord,
            although decentralized as chats and accounts can be hosted in
            servers outside of Matrix's control.</p>

            <p>If you have a Matrix account, you can directly join from there,
            but if you don't, we highly encourage you to either sign up at our
            homeserver, which uses the same domain as our site
            or to a recently updated homeserver in <a href="https://joinmatrix.org/servers/">
            Join Matrix's list of public Matrix homeservers</a>. This is in
            order to keep the Matrix network in good health.<br>
            In order to get the most functionality out of Parappa Chat, we
            recommend to use the client <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">
            Nheko</a> on desktop, and either <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">
            FluffyChat</a> or <a href="https://schildi.chat/">SchildiChat
            (Android only)</a> on mobile devices.</p>

            <p>If/Once you have a Matrix account, you can join Parappa.party's
            Matrix space below:</p>

            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            If you interact with this service in any way, you agree and
            are bound to the terms written in this page. These terms go
            as the following:

            <ol>
                <li>Do not post anything that can be considered as illegal by
                German law. This is because the homeserver is currently hosted
                in Gemany. If you use the parappa.party homeserver for malicious
                purposes you will be banned and all the offending content will
                be removed immediately.</li>
                <li>Be nice, don't be a dick. It's easier than you think.</li>
                <li>The following activities are not allowed either, and these
                will cause your account to be suspended as well: targeted
                harrassment, raids, spam, pishing and doxxing.</li>
                <li>Avoid revealing your power level. Do not post images that
                can be easily used for malicious purposes such as selfies, and
                do not reveal personally identifiable information. This is for
                your own safety and that of everyone else.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Last updated in January 8th, 2023</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Registration at the matrix.parappa.party homeserver is
                    currently <strong>open</strong>. If abuse takes place, it
                will be closed and turn into an invite-only systen instead.</li>
                <li>Guest access is currently <strong>enabled</strong>. If
                abuse happens, it will be disabled.</li>
                <li>Federation is <strong>enabled</strong>.</li>
                <li>Multiple settings have also been tuned for more stringent
                security, such as user_ips_max_age being disabled,
                bcrypt rounds being higher and nginx headers that could
                reveal IP addresses being disabled as well.</li>
                <li>All sorts of metrics are <strong>disabled</strong>.
                However, we do keep some minimum logging, which last for about
                three days and are only useful for error logging.</li>
                <li>We will <strong>NEVER</strong> sell or share your data to
                another party, no matter what.</li>
                <li>Matrix federation may couse some information to be sent
                to third party servers due to how federation works, but we are
                not liable for such a thing.</li>
                <li>If we get any sort of requests to share information with law
                enforcement, we will politely decline. We will resist against
                any further legal action unless it is absolutely necesary to
                do so.</li>
