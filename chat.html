            <h1>Welcome to Parappa.party Chat</h1>
            <p>Parappa Chat is a publicly accessible chatroom and homeserver.
            It currently uses the Matrix protocol, which is akin to Discord,
            although decentralized as chats and accounts can be hosted in
            servers outside of Matrix's control.</p>

            <p>If you have a Matrix account, you can directly join from there,
            but if you don't, we highly encourage you to either sign up at our
            homeserver, which uses the same domain as our site
            or to a recently updated homeserver in <a href="https://joinmatrix.org/servers/">
            Join Matrix's list of public Matrix homeservers</a>. This is in
            order to keep the Matrix network in good health.<br>
            You can use any Matrix client, but we recommend the nightly version
            of  <a href="https://nheko-reborn.github.io/">Nheko</a> for the
            most functionality (read: stickers)</p>

            <p>If/Once you have a Matrix account, you can join Parappa.party's
            Matrix space below:</p>

                <li>Do not post anything that can be considered as illegal by
                German law. This is because the homeserver is currently hosted
                in Gemany. If you use the parappa.party homeserver for malicious
                purposes you will be banned and all the offending content will
                be removed immediately.</li>
                <li>Be nice, don't be a dick. It's easier than you think.</li>
                <li>The following activities are not allowed either, and these
                will cause your account to be suspended as well: targeted
                harrassment, raids, spam, pishing and doxxing.</li>
                <li>Avoid revealing your power level. Do not post images that
                can be easily used for malicious purposes such as selfies, and

                to third party servers due to how federation works, but we are

                do so.</li>
