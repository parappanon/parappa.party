            <div class="div1">
          <p>Parappa.party, as said in its homepage is a fansite for the PaRappa
          the Rapper video game series. It is currently a work in progress,
          and more information about the series' history, world and trivia
          will be added as time progresses.<br>
          While Parappa.party started as a solo project, people have come
          and gone to collaborate in it at multiple points in the site's history.
          The following section is a list of of all the people who have
          contributed to Parappa.party's development; past and present,
          one-offs and longtime members.</p>

          <h2>Current Members</h2>
          <p>These are the people currently working on Parappa.party. If you
          want to get in touch with any of them, join <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:parappa.party">
          the PaRappa.party Matrix space</a> or contact them by the methods

            <p><strong>Parappanon</strong>: Being someone crazy enough to
            claim that PaRappa the Rapper saved her from going down a dark path
            in life back in 2021, Parappanon is the only person that could have
            been able to propel her passion for the series into creating this
            site. Her dedication towards the franchise knows no limits, and when
            she's not thinking about PaRappa, you better bet that she's thinking 
            about something vaguely related to it. Or messing around with *nix
            operating systems, writing something up or listening to Touhou music.

            <p><strong>Wakfu[CK]</strong>: Former co-developer and CSS guy from
            the early days of the site. Corrected Parappanon's then extremely

            in his spare time.<br>

          <h2>"Frequently" Asked Questions</h2>
          <h3>Why Matrix? Why don't you have a Discord server instead?
          </h3>
          <p>When Parappanon first bought the domain for parappa.party,
          she planned to use it as a domain for self-hosted services in order
          to get away from the tech giants, and the first thing she hosted in
          there (before the site itself even became a thing) was a Matrix
          homeserver. Parappa.party will never have a Discord server because
          creating one would be redundant due to the Matrix space's
          existence as the central discussion platform for the project, as well
          as the fact that
          <a href="https://cadence.moe/blog/2020-06-06-why-you-shouldnt-trust-discord">Discord itself is a privacy nightmare.</a>
          </p>

          <h3>How can I contribute to this site?</h3>
          <p>If you have any ideas or content you think should be added to this
          site, don't hestiate to tell us about it through the <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:parappa.party">Parappa.party
          Chat Matrix space</a> or the contact methods listed on each current
      member's Contact section.</p>
          <p>If you want to directly contribute to the site with some entries,
          code or something else instead of just telling us what you want us
          to put on a page or sending some text, we have a
          <a href="https://git.parappa.party">Gitea
          instance!</a> You'll most probably need a bit of command line
          experience for this, as well as basic HTML for most pages, but
          fortunately both Git and HTML are easy to learn (there
          are even GUI programs for Git and version control, such as
          SourceTree!). Once you've made your edits, you will have to
          solicit a merge request in order for me to add the changes, which
          Parappanon will review in order to quality control what's in the
          site.</p>

          <h3>Is there a way to financially support this site?</h3>
          <p>Parappa.party is mostly paid out of pocket for now, but if you
          like this site and want to keep it live for longer, you can donate
          thtough <a href="https://ko-fi.com/parappanon">Ko-fi</a>.</p>
