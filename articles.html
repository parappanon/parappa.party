                <p>Welcome to the Articles page!<br>
                In here, you can find all kinds of PaRappa-related texts you
                can read, both well-known and obscure, from the latest news
                on the franchise to translations of information that Japan
                knew about two decades before we even found out.<br>There also
                is a small space for more speculative or "meta" writings in this
                section, but they're only here because they have at least 
                <em>something</em> to do with <em>PaRappa</em>, this very site
                or the services hosted on the parappa.party domain. Please
                do not take the stuff in there very seriously.<br>
                Anyway, happy reading!<br>
