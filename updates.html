              <ul>
                <li>11/06/2023: Long time no see, everyone! Just here to tell you that
                    Parappa Party has officially moved domains to <a href="https://parappa.hoppingtopping.com">parappa.hoppingtopping.com</a>
                    after a brief stay at a domain owned by Wakfu[CK]!
                    In addition, you can find our Git at <a href="git.hoppingtopping.com">git.hoppingtopping.com</a>,
                    and the archive at <a href="parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com">parapparchive.hoppingtopping.com</a>.<br>
                    Matrix should be up Soon(tm).
                </li>
                <li>06/13/2023: Late is better than never, and the Mogumunya
                page is now live! Its just two pages for now, but it shall be worked
                on quickly.</li>
                <li>05/13/2023: Made a page about the home video release of the
                PaRappa anime, giving thanks to Timkho for extracting the
                thumbnails used on the page from an SWF file that was
                originally hosted at the <a href="https://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Animation/parappa/FLASH/FLASH.html">Sony
                Music PaRappa anime site</a> for me.</li>
                <li>05/11/2023: Pardon for the really shitty update, been busy
                with IRL stuff and just plain bored by writing the pages for
                the PaRappa anime episodes, so I'll move that to the backburner
                in favor of making pages that I actually want to work on.
                If you're interested on picking up work on these pages or
                anything else, feel free to contribute through PaRappa Tea
                Party.</li>
                <li>04/29/2023: Finally finished the summary for Episode 12!
                After this, I'm going to work on the Episode 13 summary, as
                well as the pages for the opening and ending singles for the
                PaRappa anime's music section, as well as the home video
                releases. Also, sorry for not saying earlier, but I sadly
                didn't get to be on the AMA from yesterday due to IRL stuff.
                Sorry to anyone who was expecting that.</li>
                <li>04/27/2023: Fixed some broken links on the Um Jammer
                Lammy trivia, then I broke some stuff again and had to
                upload some new images for the Story section of that part of
                the site... and also made a page for the second PaRappa anime
                OST disc.</li>
                <li>04/19/2023: Edited articles page a tiiny bit, and there's
                now a page for one of the PaRappa anime OST albums, so that's
                at least a little work. I'm going to be in an AMA in about a
                week, so I'll make sure to link to that somewhere on this site
                as well as on the Matrix once it happens.</li>
                <li>04/08/2023: Remodeleed the about page, changing the CSS
                    theme and also the FAQ, but just a little bit.</li>
                <li>04/06/2023: Happy late (like, really late) Easter! There
                    hasn't been much updating from the site proper's side with
                    all I've done being adding a small summary for Episode 12
                    on the PaRappa anime's story page and adding thumbnails for
                    the PaRappa anime soundtracks, but I have not only noticed
                    that the HQ scans for the games' OSTs were missing from the
                    current server's archive, but that I also needed to upload
                    all my Parappa anime-related scans, so that's what I did.
                </li>
                <li>03/28/2023: As I promised, this is a much less barebones
                update - I've added images to Episode 10's page, Episode 11's
                page has been worked on as well and the Matrix homeserver has
                been updated to Dendrite v0.12.0. Right now the Gitea instance
                is down due to some template errors, but that should be
                fixed soon as well.
                </li>
                <li>03/11/2028: HOLY SHIT THIS IS FUCKING LATE DUE TO
                ENDLESS PROCASTINATION AND SCHOOL but I guess it's mostly
                done. Summary for Episode 10 is written, although images are
                mostly missing. Pardon for the VERY barebones update for such
                a long absence, I promise to not do this again mnext time.
                </li>

                <li>02/18/2023: Sorry for dissappearing for half a month, but
                summaries for Episodes 8 and 9, as well as a fully page for
                the latter are up now! I plan to continue making pages for
                each following episode alongside their summaries, then make the
                pages for the previous episodes after that, hopefully in a
                much quicker schedule!
                </li>

                <li>02/03/2023: Given recent events, a page dedicated to
                Um Jammer Lammy NOW! has now been added to the Um Jammer
                Lammy section. Hopefully I can write a list of new things
                and differences once (if) the game gets dumped. Also, summary
                for Episode 7 of the anime is up now.
                </li>

                <li>01/29/2023: Episode 6 now has a summary and thanks to
                prximity, the code for the index page (both HTML and CSS) is
                much cleaner now.
                </li>

                <li>01/17/2023: Started actual work in the Parappa anime's
                pages, even if it's just a CSS style change and a characters
                section. A few more pages might have changed in minor ways,
                too!
                </li>

                    too!
                </li>

                <li>01/11/2023: we've finally set up base in a new server
                    with far better specifications than our original one, for
                    half the price. the matrix server has also been moved to
                    dendrite, and i've written a portal page for it now too.
                </li>

                <li>25/12/22: Merry Christmas! In order to celebrate this
                    important and highly teased day, a slew of updates have now
                    come to this site! It should be obvious that the home page
                    has been completely redesigned, but a lot of new things
                    have been added, too!
                </li>

                <li>07/10/22: We've been working on the Parappa.party
                    archives, and there should be some stuff up in there
                    already... expect more things to be uploaded there in
                    the next few days to come, as well as more progress
                    on the main site.
                </li>

                <li>29/09/22: PJ's page is now the first page in the Ultra
                    Character Database, congratulations to PJ! I've also
                    transferred the GitLab repository to a
                    <a href="https://git.parappa.party">self-hosted Gitea
                    instance</a>. The GitLab repository will be kept as an
                    archive for a while, then deleted and all future work will
                    be uploaded on Gitea instead.
                </li>

                <li>25/09/22: Characters page? Started work on alongside
                    Wakfu[CK].88x31 button? Provided so you can link to this
                    site more easily. Hotel? Trivago.
                </li>

                <li>24/09/22: Today's a pretty nice day, and also time for
                    a really nice update! Wakfu[CK] made some more CSS layout
                    imporvements, more has been added to the story section on
                    the Um Jammer Lammy page and we now even have a little
                    favicon of Chop Chop Master Onion himself!
                </li>

                <li>
                    23/09/22: The CSS got changed around a little bit
                    and improved thanks to Wakfu[CK]. You'll see most of
                    the changes on the series pages and with the disc
                    spinning animations (which aren't infinite anymore),
                    but there are also other little changes in today's
                    update as well.
                </li>

                <li>
                    22/09/22: Minor changes to quite a few pages (including
                    this one) and I also started working on the script for
                    UJL!
                </li>

                <li>
                    09/09/2022: Added the page for Um Jammer Lammy, which
                    I did first for no real reason, to be honest. However,
                    it is currently a very heavy work in progress.
                </li>

                <li>
                    07/09/2022: The portal to the Entries section is finally
                    done. It sucks more than the original Bud Uglly Design site
                    from 1996 but it still should be serviceable.
                </li>

                <li>
                    04/09/2022: Fixed the issue with the borders not showing
                    that happened yesterday, and also added dummy pages for all
                    the sections in this site. They should be worked on soon!
                </li>

                <li>
                    03/09/2022: Started working on the site layout.
                    I'm disappointed at the fact that the gaps all
                    look like solid yellow but at least I got the CSS grid
                    working so there's that.
                </li>
